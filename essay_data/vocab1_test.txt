2003_117.txt 1 0 1 1 0 i hope that this 20 minutes goes by fast because i hate typing and big brother 4 is on in the living room and i can hear it but i ca not see it my leg itches and now so does my shoulder it 's funny how when you think about something itching then lots of parts of your body start to itch i have an economics quiz tomorrow that i still have to study for maybe i will ask kristina to get me ready for it it 's my first one in college so i do not know what to expect so 20 minutes is a long time because i am out of things to say and it has only been 3 minutes my lips are kind of chapped but i do not feel like getting up to get the chapstick form the bathroom my head itches a lot today i think it must be from the weather now my arm hurts my holding it up to type since the towers does not give us a place to put our keyboards so they have to sit up high on the desk i have such bad posture when i type i slouch over a lot which makes my upper back sore i do not know if i can go for 20 minutes without going through some intense pain it has been almost 48 hours since i have talked to my mom she must think that i have been abducted i will call her after this long assignment i wish someone would call me because i am so bored and it is the first night that i have stayed home alone but i have had a lot of homework so it is good that i have been home to get it done i need to give myself a pedicure when i go home this weekend my toenails are getting really long i think i will go to the high school football game on friday if my brother goes but i am sure he will since the love of his life is on the dance team my teeth feel really grungy i guess i did not brush them after i got back from dinner but man was dinner good i love beef chalupas but i love them more when my mom makes them and puts guacamole on them i emailed a lot of people yesterday and i wonder if they have emailed me back probably not since everyone is busy with the start of school but oh well man it is really cold in here if i turn up the air then it just gets too hot and i would rather be too cold than too hot except for in the mornings when i step out into the hall to go to class it is freezing out there and then it is really warm in the elevators this place has really bad temperature control i have not gotten any mail so far it would be nice to know that people still love me and miss me they are about to announce the veto on bb4 so i am listening in to see what allison is doing she is giving a whole life story up there and she used the veto on herself which is smart anyways i still have 6 minutes left this has goe by pretty fast but now my wrists are hurting a little maybe i am developing carpultunel ( sp ) syndrome that ca not be good i miss my dogs a lot they were so cute when i went home this weekend i miss sleeping with pita my bed is so lonely without her maybe i should get a guy to replace her that sounds like a good idea i ca not wait until the new and last season of friends starts in late september i am going to cry at the season finale my roommate just said how happy she is that she did not take this class because this assignment although not mentally hard is quite physically hard only 2 5 minutes left oh happy day i wonder if any of my friends are online so that i can talk to them when i am done with this my bracelets are starting to dig into my wrist since i am putting pressure on them to type i need to get some more stuff to decorate my room it looks so plain compared to my friends' room but their room has too much stuff in it my time is almost up now i only have thirty seconds left man that really did go by now that i think about it i hope we do not have any more assignments like this one my hands hurt !
2003_118.txt 1 0 1 1 0 so i have twenty minutes to write about what i think i was thinking of all the things i thought i would write earlier , but suddenly i'm drawing a blank i think i'm going to stop trying to write properly because there 's really no point after all , i'm supposed to write what i'm thinking , and if i get to caught up in punctuation i do not think my thoughts will flow as naturally as they would if i was not' typing at all nick lachey is pretty swoll , and a pretty good singer jessica simpson can look hot , but at times she looks rather plain there are a lot of plain looking girls here , somewhat of a disappointment is not college suppose to have a lot of hot girls o well , i have a girlfriend , so it really should not matter i remember hearing that the average male thinks about sex every 7 seconds or something like that , and it looks like i'm get to that subject pretty soon i like timberland he consistently makes good beats but magoo fell off on the last single i heard from them what 's the name of that single i think its one and all i turned off the music because i do not think as randomly as usually do when its on its like i focus on the music and that is all exists maybe that is y i could be a good dj if i tried , but i never practice , and that 's why omar 's upset wit me i hope he is doing alright now he says he is , but i know he is still tripping , at least every now and then man , i told him not to trip on emmi , but what he do not know is that i trip on her too that is pretty fucked up , but i ca not help it as erin said , that girl 's seductive and she really is seductive i wonder why she is not that hot , and i see a lot of flaws when i look at her , but i still want to get with that maybe its just lust now that i think of it , it is mostly lust but i would never mistreat her well , i do not think i would mistreat her i thought i would never cheat on my girlfriend , but look what i did in cancun i can really trust my boys everytime i got a dirty secret , they shut they mouth its' not cool that i have such a big mouth i been saying i need to work on it , and i think i'm finally getting there now that i'm controlling this part of my personality , maybe i can control my hormones as well but i'm 18 , and everyone says they know what i mean when i tell them wussup felix agreed with me , even hazel life savers kickers are pretty damn good i'm tripping , thinking bout emmi again i do not know why i'm so infatuated wit her but its not that strong of an infatuation not like it was wit crystal when i saw her at the omega talent show , i still thought she was fly and i say she is a stuck up bitch , but i know if she honestly wanted to date i would not think twice i wish i was like those cats that know how to pull any girl i'm starting to realize its a game , and pulling a girl is as simple as making her think you have what she wants and needs in life i need to stop thinking bout other girls i have a gf just like i need to stop chatting on aim because all it does is keep my from doing my work i'm getting sleepy the fire alarm went off again i wonder if anyone actually watches the monitors that are hooked up to the cameras in the halls well , i guess they do seeing what happened to dennis the other day i'm getting sleepy i wonder if i meet jaymee ong if i would actually have the nerves to approach her probably not , unless i was famous like her and even then , i do not know if i would probably if i was drunk i would do it hahah i wonder if i will have the nerves to go up to carol from alpha sigma rho there i got thinking bout other girls again and here i go getting sleepy every time i take my eyes off the monitor i get sleepy my fingers are starting to get a bit tired this is the first assignment i have had that requires me to think about what to think about man , chatting online never makes me sleepy , but its the exact same thing i'm doing now sa was right it is all in my head if i could control every aspect of my behavior , that would work to my advantage no more fallen asleep wen i have to read for class , or falling asleep on the road maybe it just requires discipline not to procrastinate but it would be cool to control the mind and have telekinesis and esp i think semi just sent me a text message , but i only got a minute left , so i will wait till i'm done with this before i see what she said i want to sing if i could sing , i would rule the world hahaha maybe not , but i would feel like king right now , that is wut i want most in life
2003_119.txt 0 1 0 1 1 wow , the person next door has their music up too loud , but now they turned it down i ca not wait until the party tonight i'm not normally excited about parties , my foot hurts , i moved it well , i'm at 50 sec hmm there comes the music again i do not like that kind of music otherwise it would not bother me what does katie 's computer say she was playing solitaire my wrist itched and i scratched it is that how you spell scratched it does not look right it 's funny how simple words often do not seem like they are spelled right words like of i could think of where the o key was , there i did it again two minutes and 31 sec the green light on my router box is flashing i guess , it 's supposed to , though i would think a solid light would mean it was working right i want to know who actually reads this kind of thing , or if it is read it might be interesting , i suppose i bet people write some pretty crazy stuff i almost wrote shit there , but then realized that might be inappropriate , which is funny since i just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers particularly if they are crazy i make my self laugh inside sometimes oh goodness , i'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper i had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness 5 minutes and 16 sec wow , this is going by pretty quickly the scroll bar just started my headphones are sitting next to my computer i would like to be listening to some music right now , but of course , not my neighbor 's music maybe john mayer or counting crows , or dave matthews band or i could get my new rascal flatts cd from my car i really like every song on that cd my dad called today we have not talked since i have been back here in austin i remember last year we talked about every other night for a while i guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart i'm very close to my dad wow , i'm writing as if i'm talking to someone now , which i'm not i should stop that hmmm deep breath in and out jordan i wish he was on line , i would really like him to come to the party tonight it should be fun phred will be there though , and he did say he might go to houston with me tomorrow that 's nice of him , but i guess , maybe he owes me because i did take him home at 2 in the morning last night ( this morning ) wow , someone could find out all the crazy shit , there i said it , about someone 's life by reading these writings writing , i have not written in my journals in a long time i have been writing some in the on line diary though so yeah alec does not read it though this is hard to not edit my thoughts every now and then , i think about something and then skip to something else , then realize i should be writing everything that comes into my head down so , i am making a conscious effort not to edit , i had to look at the title of the page again to see how to spell that i'm typically i good speller maybe it 's the pressure of this writing assignment 11min and 20 sec man , this semester , all my professors have really great websites for their classes i'm so impressed i wish i was good at creating web pages then i would make one for myself , moved my feet situation again , and again , i would let everyone know about my webpage and situating myself , i would , scratched my eyebrow , i would update my webpage every day scratch my ear i do not know why i'm itching all the sudden , could not find the c key well , looked at katie 's computer again she has so many more people on her buddy list then i do i have people on my buddy list that i do not even talk to when they are on line well , a number of the people on her buddy list on people from the john mayer message boards , i wanted to call them bulletin boards , but that 's not what they are called anyway , scratching tapping my foot seeing that word tapping does not look like it 's spelled correctly oh well i guess this really is not for a grade , so it does not matter if i spell things correctly and do our minds spell correctly i do not know i would like to be a part of the ta 's studies with the tape recorder catching small glimpses into my conversations throughout the day ( though i do not have fabulous conversations ) or the study about people 's relationships and why people stay together and why they do not i mean , someone should do a study on alec and i , i would not necessarily call us dysfunctional , but i surely could be wrong in staying around for him for so long because yeah , he could treat me better , or pay me , scratching , more attention , scratching i'm getting really uncomfortable , my neck and left arm is starting to cramp up , i have not had to type this much in a long time i guess , because i have not had to write any kind of paper in quite some time well only less than 2 minutes left this has been fun i'm really uncomfortable i would like to read some other people 's writings from our class i am curious what you can tell about a person from something like this is is even accurate , because could not someone just create some elaborate or un elaborate story to put down here , or poetry or something hopefully , it does not sound like that 's what i'm doing because i'm not now , i sound paranoid , oh goodness well , nearly done 7 , 6 , 5 , 3 , 2
2003_120.txt 1 0 0 0 0 as i sit here in my dorm room , i am really tired , probably because i stayed up late doing homework last night my body feels sore but i like to workout so that does not really bother me much i can not really concentrate right now , but that is probably because i just woke up and i still feel half asleep i feel very stressed out right now because i have a chemistry exam on friday and i need to read to the chapters i guess i should not have procrastinated , but i do that a lot my roommate is actually going to class for once , and i am very happy for her hurray ! i thought this assignment was going to be a lot easier than it is , but i guess not i am really thirsty right now my hair has gotten really long , and i am very happy about that because i cut it all off recently but it is growing back my knee really hurts because i am out in the hot sun , but then go in the freezing classroom , so whenever there is a temperature change my knee aches my junior year in high school i tore my acl and had reconstructive surgery , so i have screws in it my roommate just left and it is so hard to do anything around here because she just keeps talking to me even when it is obvious i am busy how annoying ! and she uses my computer all of the time to talk to her boyfriend and it is my computer like when i got on to do this paper , she wrote that she had to go and she was sorry but hopefully i would be quick about it i wanted to tell her something so bad but we have to live together for a year and i do not want to make it a living hell i do not know how to approach the situation with out us hating each other , but if this keeps on , i will end up hating her living with girls sucks because we are all so petty i skipped my calculus discussion this morning , but it is my only class on tuesdays and thursdays and it had to be at 8 a m in rlm , which is so far and i hate that building ! well my time is just about up and i am really excited because i am tired of typing
2003_121.txt 1 1 0 0 0 my roommate finally just left for work ! i do not mean to say finally with such a relief , but my head is just pounding from her music ! i really like her a lot , we get along great , we just do not have the same taste in almost anything now , i'm not a neat freak , but living in such a small place for the next nine months , i would kind of like to keep the room picked up i do not think she feels the same way ! this morning , she ate cheerios , but threw most of them away , so our room smelled like rotten cheerios all morning she finally threw them away , it 's not so bad i think some of her habits and ways come hand in hand with the fact that she is an art major i do not mean to be stereotypical , it just seems that the artist in her contributes to her taste in many things twenty minutes sure is a long time to write ! that could also be because i'm not much of a writer i used to like to write for fun , when i was younger , but being forced to do things makes me tend to not enjoy them as much now , this is not so bad because i'm not worried about correct spelling , punctuation , capitalization , etc , so i sure hope those things do not matter ! i ca not believe i waited until three hours before the due date to do this paper actually , i can , i am such a procrastinator i think it is the worst feature about myself especially now in college , when there really is no time for procrastination there always seems to be some sort of studying or reading i could be doing , but then again , there are a million other things that are just so much more appealing and at the time seem to be just as important as that homework ! like for instance , it would almost be a sin to not see the final episode of my favorite tv show , or to miss out on what the rest of my friends are doing ! only three other girls i went to high school with came to ut this year , and two of them live right across the hall ! it 's so strange how things work out speaking of strange things , i saw a girl that i was best friends with when we were very young , like kindergarten through second grade ! i could not believe we even recognized each other ! it was so crazy ! it was great to see her then last night , i saw a boy that i went to junior high with , he actually lives on the same floor as me ! i moved around a lot when i was younger , so the people i see , most likely do not even know each other ! wow , i just looked up at the timer and it 's already been more than fifteen minutes ! that sure went by a lot faster than the first five ! i wanted to go home this weekend , but i'm waiting until next , our town is having the county fair then i do not want to admit that i miss home because i told everyone that i could not wait to leave ! i was tired of the small town gossip and the close minded ideas of all those small town people ! i do love it here in austin and i even have some family here , but i miss my parents ! i think i might even miss my two younger brothers , now that 's crazy ! i think i just miss everything ! i miss my kitty and i especially miss my best friend ! he went to texas tech and i keep telling myself that i will never see him again , but i pray that i will !
2003_122.txt 0 0 1 1 0 i really like the song that was on mtv just now simple plan is a cool band i wonder what my friends are doing later for supper i do not feel like going to class at 6 i just want to sleep i wish my boyfriend and i would stop getting into arguments it really sucks when we fight , i hate it ! i'm kind of hungry where is my roommate it seems like she is never here oh well , more private time for me i miss my mom i have so much to read for my classes chapters and chapters and chapters ! looks like i have my work cut out for me for a long time my spanish class seems really easy , i hope it gets harder , so i feel more challenged i wonder when i should go talk to an advisor about my major should i change it , not change it , minor , or double major why is everything so difficult all questions and decisions in life should be yes no or multiple choice ! that would be so wonderful celebrities are so gorgeous , they suck although , they are pretty cool people i guess , i do not really know them i have an itch on my leg i hope i do not get sick , that would be horrible i ca not wait for the game on saturday it 's going to be so much fun rap music gets on my nerves i need to finish taking pictures on my camera so i can get them film developed why is so cold in here i turn the air warmer , and it gets too hot , then i turn it cooler , and it gets too cold ! that sound is annoying , i wonder if the ac is supposed to make that noise this room needs to be vacuumed it 's gross my mom sent me a letter yay ! i'm excited , but i ca not open it until i'm done writing this assignment ! i need to turn my closet light off i'm thirsty i feel like drinking a dr pepper that sounds so yummy ! i think i might eat a pickle when i'm done too that sounds like a plan i'm almost done with this thing mom uses ugly stamps oh well , i have cute ones
2003_126.txt 1 1 0 0 1 i have been extremely pissed off for the entire day i have just started classes again at ut i am trying to get into the pharmacy school i work at a pharmacy now , but the people there are driving me insane i have panic disorder , but lately instead of panicking i am just angry i almost ran into about 5 cars driving on mo pac road rage ! my therapist is trying to assure me that i am not the one who is crazy it 's just the people around me my job , my parents , my friends i am taking things out on john who does not deserve it he is just here all the time i wrote him a nasty email and i think he just replied he is so sweet , i really should make a huge effort not to do that to him he is probably used to it after 3 years yuck i would have been tired of my temper tantrums a long time ago i tried acupuncture today for anxiety and my irritable bowel syndrome the guy treating me at the student clinic was a moron i usually get good people he is graduating soon from that academy and i am scared of what he will do to his patients i am going to take a xanax now and see how long it takes me to calm down cool , i can time it ready , go ok i have to work all weekend when i need to be studying my wrist hurts maybe from typing , maybe from that moron this should be pretty interesting for someone to read i have lots of other homework that i could be doing , but this is all i have the brain power for right now no offense , but it 's not biochemistry i am glad to be back in school i hit the wrong key and it stopped for like 3 seconds weird i have to work with john the head pharmacist this weekend they are all trying to manipulate me into working more hours than i want to they have now told me that if i do not work all of these hours that they will find someone else to work there it 's all or nothing i know they are bluffing , because it would take them so long to train someone that one of the other techs that works at the store would have to cover the weekends for months no one wants to work weekends so i should do it because i'm in school and that 's easier for me because i am a student that 's their logic that 's crap i think i'm almost done bitching i am going to work tomorrow and if he does not make some compromise with me then i may just walk out and let him work by himself that wo not happen he will say anything to keep me there and i will probably fall for it and think everything is ok and then he will just change his mind at the end of the weekend so , i should just change jobs , or just change stores eckerd 's sucks they all have their heads up their butts aaaah ! i guess i feel a little better now , but not much i will just have to think about something else if i am going to feel better my glasses are foggy they always get scratched because i do not take care of them i need an eye exam have not had one since grade school who says grade school i'm old i have to be good this weekend even though i am going to a birthday party that will probably be not quite as good as i need to be whatever , that did not make sense i wonder when john will be home at least i'm getting something done i need to do a lot of things i need to send transcripts to ut , start looking at pharm apps and ask john if he is really going to move with me if i go out of state i will probably get in for next fall but you never can tell i applied way too late last year and got stuck on the stupid alternate list ok , next
2003_127.txt 0 0 0 0 1 right now i am feeling tired and a little burnt out i have had a quiz and a test this week so i ve been stressed out i have not taken my chemistry test yet so i'm nervous about that i have studied but i do not feel prepared it 's cold in our dorm room right now it 's cloudy outside which is how i feel about certain aspects in life i'm not sure i will accomplish my goals in life though i know that if i give it my best effort that there is nothing more i could have done no one is in the room other than me so i'm feeling a little lonely not too much though sometimes it is nice to be alone i have always enjoyed being alone everynow and then i feel like i need to relax i did not get tickets to the game this saturday so i'm pissed about that i did get tickets to the ou game though so that made me happy i like to listen to music it also helps me to relax i'm listening to music right now as a matter of fact i have a heavy course load , though not too bad i know that if i quit that i will regret it for the rest of my life i think regret is probably one of the worst feelings in the world next to loneliness loneliness you could almost always fix , but regret is much harder to deal with time is going by too slowly , i think i'm running out of stuff to talk about it does feel good to get your feelings out and onto something like paper sometimes i think it would be better to write out all your feelings on paper so that someone would not have to sit there and listen to you bitch about your life all the time but other times that 's exactly what you need my favorite tv show is scrubs the main character portrays me down to a t watching scrubs is another way i relax i'm not necessarily worried about my chemistry test , or at least not to the point of where i'm dreading going i know that all i can do is my best i know i have talked about this but i love music i can feel it in my soul when it plays i can feel the song i can feel the notes , the rhythms , all of it i can close my eyes and just get lost in a song it 's weird , i know my time is almost up i'm hungry it seems like now that i'm thinking about how hungry i am that it is taking longer to finish than it did before i'm writing this at 9 15 a m that 's not necessarily early in my book but it is definitely too early to do this i have a lot of reading to do i'm happy to be at ut it 's what i have wanted to do all my life i want to be a doctor a heart surgeon actually it seems like its going to be tough which is no surprise i need to buckle down more next week , it starts what is it you ask it is me buckling down and going hardcore on my classes 2 minutes left ! this was easier than i thought it would be 1 minute left i almost forgot to write this that would have sucked and i would have been pissed but i remembered so i happy i feel better writing down all this

2003_130.txt 0 1 1 0 1 i do not know i fell kind of weird talking to a computer well today has been a really strange day i did not start school until 2pm so that was great it lets me get lots of sleep i think if i did not get enough sleep i would be more stressed out then what i already am ok feeling weird again i do not know what to type about ok , well yesterday i realized this guy that has three classes with me so that is kind of cool i went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes we later found out we had another class together , philosophy it is such a big class , i was not surprised i never notice this guy was in my class after that i went to read by psychology book because i'm kind of behind on my reading today i finally caught up i feel better in that sense , but i'm still behind in my other courses it 's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time but i see other people and they seem to be doing less work then i am they are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating if none applies then i kind of feel sorry for them this weekend i finally get to go home i'm kind of happy to go back because i miss my baby sister she is like one year old , so i hate to miss her growing up she is really funny and i love her a lot when i'm at home she follows me everywhere as for my parents i miss them too , buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them more stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress i love my parents and all , but i like living on my one well kind of , still have a roommate when i go back home i get preferred treatment this is because my parents miss me a lot i'm actually not that home struck , i do not find it too difficult to live afar i think this is partially because i know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away i do feel sad that i'm not spending time with my family though in this sense i feel inhumane , because i made the final choice of coming to austin well it seems like half my time is over and i am starting to run out of mind speech ok , i'm just typing to type well , then that water bottle looks really good about now i actually find college possible as long as i find time to study that is the hard part because i spend most of my time walking from class to class , cleaning my room , doing laundry , taking a shower , eating , or just relaxing for a moment there are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time it 's kind of aggravating but i guess that 's just the way life is i guess someday i will get to rejoice in all that i have accomplished in the far future i am scared of failure , but i deal with it it 's not the end of the world i like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else i will use it as an excuse to not do something i think psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific i was like wow , i remember reading about that but do not exactly remember the detail to answer the question that is another thing i am afraid of not being capable to learn all the stuff i need too i know that if i gave myself enough time , like years i could definitely remember the details but in the allotted time i have to learn all this information , along with other classes , just thinking about it makes my head hurt i ca not picture myself learning every single thing the book has especially when i have 5 books , and i have to learn almost all the information in all the books yeah , well i got my head hurting again one good side is that this typing thing is almost over and i can continue studying although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life , this is what actually goes on in my head all the time especially the headache part i think one of my major weaknesses is my english basically i learned english from tv because no one at my house spoke it i guess my first language was spanish , until i began watching tv and understood it i hate having weak english skills though because i always below average i guess its the one thing i will never be good at
2003_131.txt 0 0 0 1 0 it 's 6 48 i think i will type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top as i sit here , looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard , i wonder what my girlfriend is doing since i am using her computer ca not wait till monday ! i finally get my own internet set up at my apartment i feel like i'm getting sick i was sneezing a lot the other day , now i have a slight sore throat i wonder what the purpose of this assignment is is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy work gah ! i hate this runny nose ! my girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me a little too many hope she is getting a good work out at the gym right now i need to find more time to go to the gym now going to the gym everyday for a few minutes is not that good , right wow i feel like my ex roommate all he ever did was study , go to the gym , and hang out with his girlfriend , too i wonder what i will do for dinner tonight i should eat healthier learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help i hope i'm doing this assignment correctly oh well , if i'm not , i can just ask a ta just to make sure it 's only been 6 min and 15 sec wow , this is going to be longer than i thought oh look , it 's bloat ( a toy from mcdonalds that was in the movie finding nemo ) what a great movie that was best children 's movie i have seen in a long time i'm feeling more ill now this ca not be good maybe i should not go out tonight ugh , that 's right i wo not be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over oh well , i have been spending a lot of time with her recently it 's understandable i need to find some tissues there 's a roll of paper towels and toilet paper i think i will grab some toilet paper hahaha it 's just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper sigh i miss those good old simple days a lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then it was good to be young i know what i would like to do right now ! i want to play counter strike ! too bad i ca not install it onto her computer i wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she is should be obvious , so no worries what homework reading assignments do i need to take care of this weekend hmm , i'm taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now , i still need to do that one experiment ( which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and i ca not go any further ! ) , leb , fin , maybe a little cms reading i think that should take care of it oh wait got to do the eco self homework tomorrow look , she is back ! aw , she is tired from working out what ! she just told me how everyone has commented on my latest pictures on her board ! apparently , people think it 's a good picture of me i guess it is i actually like those pictures of me ( which is kind of rare ) i wonder if i can type like i do when i'm online grammatically incorrect ! that would speed up my typing look ! i'm at 19 minutes now ! 19 is a great number all done now !

2003_136.txt 0 1 1 0 1 my knuckles are aching i'm going to pop them , lot of clicking on the keyboards in the computer lab , i keep hearing a long beep ever now and then and it is really annoying , i wish i could type better and faster and not have to use one finger , my joints are still aching i want to constantly move to pop them , my head itches and my armpits are moist and sticky , i keep having to raise my arms to keep the stickiness down and more my shirt out of my pits , my toe needs to pop and my right ring finger itches , i wonder what jenn is doing i bet she is with gus , gosh do i hate that guy he just gets on my nerves and does not deserve her or treat her right , but then he is cool when i'm around very annoying , it rained earlier so it was really humid after psychology , but now the air conditioning in the library is just what i need , the back of my shoe has no fabric on it so where my sock is not present my shoe rubs blisters into the flesh , another chair squeaks as some shifts their weight , a guy is talking on his phone which i always thought was a bad idea and now he is done , the weird thing about this assignment is that all i'm really thinking about is the assignment and having to think things up , i feel like it does not accurately establish what i'm think because i i ca not type as fast as a thought comes up , my eye is burning and i feel a tear coming up its like an uncontrollable itch that i'm going to have to rub for a while , another phone goes off , its amazing how many phones there are and how everyone has their own little ring , now someone wo not answer their phone and it is still going off , my knee itches , i scratch it , a zipper is undone , another person leaves the computers , and another one sits down automatically , to guys are talking and kind of annoying me , walking around with their smug looks and acting like they own it all and do not have to abide by any rules of silence , that same beep again , i scratched my knee again , i wonder what i'm going to make for dinner , i'm really hungry right now but i still have my lab , stupid labs all at weird times and all out of whack , some one coughs over the loud and oddly rhythmic type emulating from about 50 computers , i shift my weight because my ass is falling asleep and cause my chair to creek as everyone takes a pause to listen look and become annoyed , more squeaking , and now my forearms are sore from resting on the edge of the table to long , i really worry about problems with my hands from typing and using a mouse and also from popping my knuckles , carri 's dad has i guess a calcium deposit on his knuckle from clicking a mouse too much its pretty deformed looking , but funny , the library seems to weirdly old yet modern , a lot of the signs make me think of my elementary school and just stuff from then like the walls but its so enormous and imposing i completely stop thinking about it , i sneeze and cover my mouth but now i type so i spread my saliva everywhere i feel bad for who ever uses this next , knuckles again , some guy is looking out if the window and i want to know what he is thinking and what he is looking at , i was thinking about this one think dr pennebaker was talking about how we are all programmed to react to movement and sound , i guess i always knew and tried to avoid it but i do not think many people actually think about it , i think its actually pretty cool because i'm now thinking about how it is one those derived characteristics we got from our ancestors i guess who hunted or had natural predators just being able to react when ever something moved or made a noise , probably a good thing not to evolve out of , 311 rocks evolver is a good step up for them , i notice i get really startled easily when i'm alone in my room engulfed in tv or a computer , my mom and anyone can come in and say hi and ill jump like the dickens even though it was not that big of a deal i wish jenn felt the same way it would be nice and also bad because
2003_137.txt 0 1 0 0 1 wow this page is not really what i was expecting besides that ticking timer thing in the top is distracting me because i see it ticking damn i tried to scroll down thinking i could move it out of my view to avoid distraction but it wo not scroll typing is annoying me i can do it fairly well and fast without looking but i keep screwing up random letters and making typos and i'm tired of using backspace well then i just picked on my face and now it kinda hurts on my chin i just looked and the timer and it already says 2 minutes wow this is going faster than i thought i actually thought i would not mind this assignment too much because it seems kinda fun to just type whatever a persons thoughts are plus its not a typical assignment i love when assignments have time limits my right arm hurts its a bad setup for typing at my desk all my computer and everything is diagonal so it can fit but its bad to type this way for long periods of time i just had so much trouble typing the i in periods for some reason it was annoying me wow 5 minutes i keep having to adjust in my seat not so comfortable and my legs are not feeling right there 's no good place to put them and my underwear are riding into my ass its really fucking annoying ok i fixed it well i thought so ok i think that 's better now i just got a blank and for a second i was actually thinking about nothing or it seemed to be nothing is that even possible i do not think it is i think probably someone is always thinking about something maybe they just do not know what it is consciously or something there 's people screaming in the hallway someone wants to get into a room or something man this is kinda frustrating because i keep feeling like i'm trying to actually say things worthwhile and then when i start talking about what i'm thinking about i think about other things in the middle of a word or something and it throws me off and just generally confuses me well i still have about 10 minutes of useless babbling to do my boyfriend is one of the things that keeps randomly popping into my head and when i'm about to type it , my ass hurts or there 's people screaming in the hallway or something so then i'm thinking about that i like to think about my boyfriend sometimes i actually do it on purpose and then other times i'm trying to pay attention in class or something and it becomes a distraction anyway i do not really know where i'm going with this my roommate let me read hers ( she just did this a minute ago ) and mine sounds a lot like hers its kinda freaky i think there 's holes in this stream of consciousness theory ( that looks funny i do not think its spelled right i did not think something else up there looked right either but i do not remember what it was ) the holes ! i ca not type as fast as i think and therefore i ca not really keep up with what i'm actually thinking about but its kinda clever anyway there should be a way to actually hear peoples thoughts while they are thinking them or something like that like ummm what women want but actually i do not really want anyone to be able to hear my thoughts just for the sake of science because that 's assuming someone could hear them whenever they wanted to and that 's just creepy i'm sitting weird and its hurting my right leg and now my left arm hurts i adjusted earlier to try and solve the diagonal thing ( aha ! that 's what was spelled wrong earlier heheh ) um someones knocking on our door its weird my roommate said come in and they went away i do not know what 's going on actually rebeccas bitching because quiet time starts at ten that 's true though maybe they had the wrong room or something this is a hard assignment for me because i'm anal and i do not want to leave things unfinished and i keep doing that i wanted to finish what i was saying earlier ooo 19 36 the time draws near this is kinda strangely fun actually i might do it sometime probably not
2003_139.txt 0 1 1 1 1 this is a hard assignment in the sense that i do not know what i am thinking i have so much homework to do today i really wish that i had more time to do everything i need to do before a new week starts i cannot believe that it is already september i am so ready for another three day weekend i wish we had another break before thanksgiving holiday it is such a pretty day outside i really should have exercised i wonder if i will have time tomorrow oh well i really need to go grocery shopping i have nothing to eat in the apartment i should ask kristen if she wants to go to the store with me something else i need to do is call grace about my trip to visit her this october i really hope that the trip works out i miss her she is the funniest girl ever i really want mexican food for dinner , but i am having italian oh well , italian could also be good at least i wo not eat a thousand chips before i even get my meal instead i will eat about a pound of bread does that even make sense a pound of bread oh i guess i mean a loaf of bread whatever it is so quiet in this room right now i wish there was something going on so that i could have something funny to think and therefore type about this stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read actually i bet some of them are really interesting to read i always am wondering what other people are thinking about i wish that i was a better typer i am a little faster than i use to be , but i still make a ton of mistakes this essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts i have in a twenty minute period oh i guess that i am not the only person home right now i heard a door close it must be kristen or catherine i love living in an apartment it is so different that last year i never made my bed i should get in the habit of making my bed when i get out of bed each day but then i know i would want to take a nap that day , and then i would just mess up the covers again beds are meant to be unmade i guess that is how i feel now , but wait until i have a family of my own i totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day i wish that i was as organized as my mom she always has everything in the right place i guess i will grow into being more organized one of theses days i guess wow the time really has gone faster than i expected for this essay but now that i noticed the time i bet it goes even slower i hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 15 minutes that happened to me in math friday i think because it was my last class on friday , i was just anxious for the weekend i love the weekends i wish i could have gotten more sleep this weekend i feel like i never get enough sleep i in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie i wonder what movie i really am in the mood for a really good movie that i have not seen or that i love i have not been to the movie theater in so long i think the last movie that i saw was pirates of the caribbean it was good jonny depp looked really crazy in the movie orlando bloom is so cute i wonder how old he is i bet he is in his early twenties just the perfect age for me i like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity i really wish that i had a crush on someone right now i feel like there is no one i want to date right now that is the worse feeling what time is it it is getting late the day has gone by so fast i need to do so many more things today i should probably start taking my notes for geography today so that i do not have so much to do tomorrow i am so sick of taking notes right now though i really need to stay motivated !
2003_140.txt 0 0 0 1 1 what a strange assignment why did the typing start indented twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster it 's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck what do wounded ducks look like alright , 1 complete with this assignment physics is really hard , but i actually understand everything fairly well i suppose that 's a plus i wish lindsay would talk to me i really miss her companionship i suppose now is where you notice that i am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions i really hate to be normal i am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard i instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else i really miss lindsay i wish i knew what to do to get he back i think that is the problem , you ca not get someone back , you can only hope they come back i really hope the power does not go off in the middle of this assignment ( knock on wood ) it 's been going out recently alright , almost 25 complete maybe i should not track my progress is anybody really going to read this is this simply an experiment maybe it 's a wpm counter like in computer class here comes the scary part in the music i am listening to firebird suite it really is a neat song , but it lacks something , not sure what but something what if you started this assignment at 4 50 on friday that would really be horrible , but it would not be quite as bad as starting it at 4 41 that would actually be ironically funny good times something is odd not sure what , but something seems a bit strange i want some natural light , i really ca not stand these fluorescent lights these buildings also are disturbing i did not live in the country , but i really miss the trees i had around my house living amongst these lonely trees is strange it 's like they are put on display as something that used to be i want to go to a school that is in the trees i am talking a tree house in the trees of the amazon that would be a sweet experience the window , right haha , of course i open my window and see construction great , just great it 's rather depressing alright , more than 50 complete this could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts might find something you do not want to find hmm i hat that feeling of being hungry after you have just ate is ate the right word there i think it might be eaten , who knows i feel like i have something to do , but i really do not know what it is it felt really good to sleep in this morning i kind of felt lazy , but none the less , it felt great i saw cedric benson in his escalade xlt today that is a very nice vehicle he has almost 75 completed what a bunch of crazy rambling it must suck to be the one to read all of these i suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness is that a word who cares i know you do not i am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts , perhaps i should learn how to more properly type i type pretty well i think , i just have this mysterious pain in my pinky shadows are the only two dimensional objects shadows are cast from three dimensional objects so is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects can we say that we are shadows of time there 's a predicament what is time that 's also a predicament that would be cool if somebody would call me right now i really do not want to have to get up so early on saturday ( 7 00 ) oh well , ca not do much about it i guess i wonder how phoebe is doing that thought was brought on by a song that i just heard time is almost up check you on the flip side ciao
2003_141.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i need to write this paper for psychology to get a good grade in the class this assignment is much easier than some of the other assignments i have gotten in my other classes but , then again , my other classes are not necessarily hard i mean , in history of rock music , i have to go see a concert and report on it how cool is that ! i wish i could go to a coldplay concert i would love to go to a coldplay concert i like their music i like the beatles too i'm listening to a beatles song right now i believe paul wrote michelle i went to the paul mccartney concert last october it was totally amazing i wish i could go again i saved my ticket stub and put it in a box that i store all the important little trinkets i want to keep i put all my concert tickets in there i really need good grades in order to get into the rtf school i really want to become a film maker i would love to become the next jerry bruckheimer producing seems really cool , but really hard i would love to direct , but directing seems like one of the most impossible jobs to do successfully i would love to one day be a well known and respected film maker i love old films last sunday , the state theater on congress showed gone with the wind i went to the movie instead of the ut football game i do not like football as much as i like old movies it was so worth it to see one of my favorite movies of all time on the big screen was amazing i walked to the theater , and i decided to take the bus back only , i was not aware that the busses have different route on game days i got on the number 7 bus and ended up around highland mall it turned out okay though , because the bus circles the mall and comes back towards campus i got off the bus on dean keaton street and had to walk back to my dorm in jester in the rain the movie was still worth it dean keaton that 's also the name of the main character in the movie the usual suspects that is a good movie for the longest time , i had not seen it , but then my brother kept telling me that i should not see it because it is excellent well , during move in a couple of weeks ago , when everybody was in a frenzy , i just hung out for a couple of days at my brother 's house while there , i got a chance to see the usual suspects what a great film the ending was amazing , even though someone had already told me how it ended i was surprised all the same ah ! people keep instant messaging me while i am trying to do this essay i'm going to put up an away message so they will leave me alone for a while my mother called me this afternoon to tell me that the product i ordered online came in the mail i need to go pick it up it was my first order on ebay a friend of mine and i really like david beckham , so i found some england national team jerseys with his name on the back online for only 10 a piece we have been waiting about 2 weeks for them to come in the mail , but i guess that is not that long considering they were being shipped from thailand i hope they are in good condition i mean , for 10 , one would assume they are in total disarray i hope not i really want a beckham jersey wow , i am really writing about absolutely nothing this assignment is awesome ! now i'm listening to a dave matthews band song the song that jane likes i just started liking dmb only about 2 years ago my best friend idolizes them and plays all their songs on his guitar gabe is an awesome guitar player i wish he was with me here at ut i really miss him he is back at home , while everyone else we know moved on to college i feel bad for him i wish he would move to austin with me he works at starbucks and is trying to raise enough money for him to go to school i love starbucks i used to always get a caramel macchiato , but now i really like irish cream cafe mochas those are very good i have not really had any time to go to starbucks there 's one in the bottom floor of jester center , but its just not the same as an actual cafe house gabe and i would regularly hang out at the starbucks by us for hours on end we would talk or play cards or chess i really miss that its okay though , he is coming to visit soon , and i will be going home for his birthday in a couple of weeks it should be fun i'm really excited about that
2003_142.txt 0 0 1 0 1 well , i'm listening to 3 doors down my friend told me about this song , and it 's pretty good it 's about people being in love i'm about to change the song to so far away by staind they are my favorite band my roommate is not here right now i just got finished eating with my brother he is 31 and the best big brother when he dropped me off at jester that was the first time that i have cried since i have been here i did not even cry when my mom left i guess our relationship is stronger even though i do not get to see him that much i think my roommate and i are going to lake lbj this weekend i have a house on the lake we will probably invite a few friends to join us i guess get away from the dorm life and act like it 's summer again man , i have a lot to do i need to return two books , mail a couple of letters , and some other stuff i should be writing this down oh well hmmm i'm running out of things to talk about oh yeah , the smell it smells kinda funny in here because we had chicken wings the other day , and we still have not cleaned out the dishes oh yeah , i have to do laundry too dang , that 's going to be a pain i have tons of laundry to do i will probably wait until this weekend because then i can use my own washer and dryer i wo not have to wait for anyone else now i have to go to the bathroom i wonder if that counts off if i stop for a second well , i'm going to try and hold it in i wish we had a bathroom in here then it would not be that big of a hassle to go to the bathroom real quick hmmm my roommate and i have been hearing these strange noises from the room above us it sounds like this people are having sex like the bed is moving or something we are not sure yet , but i think we are going to go up there and see what 's going on we thought it was a laundry room , but who knows i have been trying to find this song i know the tune of it i just ca not place the words so i'm having no luck i'm just adding words that sound good i heard it in my brother 's car , but he was talking and i did not want to interrupt i'm looking at some pictures on my wall wait someone just sent me a text message it was a guy named david i met him last sunday walking passed his room he seems like a nice guy we went out last night to a movie in dobie we got there early so we had about an hour and a half to spare so , we decided to take a look around dobie 's room so we just started knocking on doors and taking a look at people 's rooms it was crazy , but i liked it nothing was planned out we just started hanging out and then we thought a movie would be nice and just went it was excited i hate having things planned out i do not mind just sitting at home and being lazy just taking things when they come along i do not know if damn , i hate pop ups one just popped up while i was typing anyways i do not know if that 's a good thing or bad well , i have about a minute left and that david guy is coming over perfect timing i think things happen for a reason i'm into reading horoscopes and stuff like that i guess it 's kinda childish
2003_144.txt 0 1 1 0 0 geez , i'm trying to think about what i'm supposed to write about for 20 minutes this is weird i wonder if people use this assignment as a dear diary thing i wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments that would be a lot of reading to do how can they read so much i get so tired of reading all the time i want to have fun instead of having fun though , i'm always stuck in my room reading all the time i hate reading school reading is not fun text book reading that is i do not like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems no one reads the text book crap i do not even understand why some classes have certain books hm i just do not like reading i think this means that i'm going to have problems in college later on everyone always tells me that when you are in college , you have to have the patience to read everything if what i read what actually interesting , i would not have a problem hmm , well i remember in english in high school , a lot of the books that we read were really interesting i liked lord of the flies and anthem , and the scarlett letter those were really cool books the bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze every single thing ! i hated analyzing i mean , analyzing is important , but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff i remember on the scarlett letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green what the hell was that all about i do not ' get it ! there are some things that do not really need explaining they are just fact how can you explain fact seriously , i think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head i think they are trying to teach us something on that how well you can come up with some explanation in a split second actually , i guess that can come in handy like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late you would not get a good grade if your reasoning was not valid enough hmm i do not know some teachers are cool i miss my teachers back at home i miss mr fred , he was such an awesome teacher i somewhat liked calculus because of him he had a weird personality that 's what made him cool i also miss mrs conrey she was fun to talk to too i miss our little group in bio2 that was my favorite class ! i loved hanging out with the gang geez , i ca not believe that time is gone life went by so fast i wish i could go back and relive some moments not to change them but to feel that kind of happiness again now , everyone is so concerned with getting to know new people i mean , i do not mind getting to know new people but not everyone likes the whole hi , my name 's rebekah , what 's yours i think certain people would get really annoyed by that geez , there are so many people in this school , it 's not even funny i miss knowing everyone you pass by it 's kinda like that cheers song where everybody knows your name dum da da dum and they are always glad you came dum da da dum i love that show hehe , it 's great geez , life passes by way too quickly it 's kinda funny to think about how that was the seinfeld or friends during that decade hehe , but it 's still funny it 's funny how people do not like watching those old shows anymore i do not care how old they are if they are funny , they are funny that 's all that matters it gets annoying how everyone puts up with the same friends reruns it 's so annoying but still a great show i remember when a new season would start , everyone would say ohh , this is the last season ! the last season is finally here i mean the show is still really funny and all but come on everyone knows that it was getting really old everyone 's hooking up with someone else it 's kinda annoying but kinda cute how that worked out but i think it 's wrong how joey hooks up with rachel i'm sorry but ross and rachel belong to only each other it 's wrong to see them not together i really hate how they are not married on the show dude , you should not have a kid unless you are married you are just asking for your kid to have problems if you are not what the hell is this all about how girls have sex b 4 marriage i think it 's so stupid ! what the hell happened to good morals and traditions now everyone 's a whore that 's so disgusting how can you share yourself with everyone you see grr , people annoy me
2003_145.txt 0 1 0 1 0 right now i am really hungry i would go eat right now but i am going to run with the marathon team tonight i ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but i did not run during the summer lets hope i'm still in shape probably not , i'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again this stream of consciousness in not fun my thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type it 's like when i'm writing an english paper i will get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and i forget it good thing you are not checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that i hate typing on the computer , well not typing but talking on the computer the i'm stuff instant messaging my roommate keeps asking me questions while i'm doing the writing she talks on i'm all the time she spends more time in the room on the computer than i do and that 's hard to do she wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to it 's 8 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on i never liked talking on i'm and i have tried to i think many of the things i say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone so i pissed of a few people even though i was being sarcastic and it could be that i am quiet and do not talk that much unless it 's about sports or something i'm weird , i think i'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports i have always liked to watch sports and i pretty much know that i am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 2 i have always liked playing video games like right now i have grand theft auto vice city on my computer it is a lot of fun i love playing i see it as a stress relief for me when i had a hard day i will start play the game run from the cops then feel better i am able to do things in the game that i would never do in real life i would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that 's why i like to do it in the game because i can and will not get punished for it the people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional all the cops look the same , all the pedestrians look the same you can tell that this is not real life if you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you now i know that does not happen in real life there are clear distinctions between the game and real life i know those distinctions and would not cross them some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun

think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings i keep thinking about kurt and i wonder if i should call him back or not everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but i do not even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did i think my foot is falling asleep i almost wish i had a desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small my hand keeps hitting the mouse while i type and it waves around in front of what i'm writing and that makes it hard to concentrate anyways , i do not want kurt to think that i have been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first a pop up just came up on my screen i did not think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and i did not want to because with all my pop ups i figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so i tried to push the little x in the corner and it would not close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work at first i thought it was for this maybe it was but then i got back to this screen and my time was starting all over that sucks i hope this is over soon anyways i'm still thinking about kurt no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together he could just want to talk he did say the first time that he just called to see how i have been and i'm still mad at him for what he did but i do want to forgive him because i just do not want something like that hanging over me forever and i hate to hold grudges and i do want us to be friends and i know it would be hard for me to say i did not want him back but even if that is what he wanted i would not do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me plus i'm in college and i do not need to have a boyfriend back home i need to meet people but i really do miss him a lot i hope it gets easier which is part of why i will call him because i really need to close that part of my life and end it and i ca not think of the word but something like finalize it i hope my battery does not die on my laptop and i hope that another popup does not come and mess up my time again because i really need to get this done i have a lot to do today but i'm glad i got done what i did this morning i need to find out about the whole football ticket draw thing and i hope i wrote down in my planner about that trig review class then i have all those small chores that i have to do tonight but i do not think ill have time especially since this is taking so long i have never experienced a longer twenty minutes than this in my life at least i should be improving my typing skills i hope it rains this weekend or even today no maybe tomorrow because ill be outside today i ca not wait until it get cooler outside so i can walk places yeah right like i really will but maybe i really will i have taken the stairs up to my room a few times i think i may fall asleep after this or maybe even right now i need to move my leg this hurts wow i'm really really sleepy o i also need to remember to call joey back tonight before i call back kurt i feel so bad i hope he is not mad at me for ditching them but i needed to go out with christi because we had not really done anything together and i'm glad i did because that was a lot of fun but i do hope he is not mad or anything and we can get together later i wonder if i should join the texas exes i do not know if this is really what i'm thinking because i know in the back of my head all i'm really thinking about is how much i hate typing all this and how i ca not wait until its over but at least i'm doing it today instead of tomorrow night so ill have it done and do not have to worry about it i'm going to try and not procrastinate bad start though i'm only on chapter one in psychology those chapters are so long and boring i hate that book i hope this does not deduct points i wonder if i should stop now since that pop up messed up my timer oh well i only have about four minutes left anyways so i might as well keep going o i need to go tanning tonight too ahhhh i have so much to do tonight and most of it involves reading that damn psychology book o and i have to read that philosophy book i really like my schedule how it is though that is nice that i do not have any real classes today so i can get caught up yay i'm almost finished good because i'm really sleepy now and i want to take a nap even though there is no way that i really have time for that but maybe i will anyways just like a few minutes to rest my eyes yeah right ill fall asleep and probably wo not wake up until like nine or ten i spell out numbers because i do not know what keys to use yay i'm finished
2003_150.txt 1 0 1 0 1 here it goes 20 minutes seems like a long time but i do not have to think really wait , that is the whole purpose think , think , think the game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but i would never say anything just let it be , let it be , whisper words of wisdom , let it be well , i see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend hopefully i can get her a ticket to the game maybe i will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that i will buy a ticket for , lets say , 10 i think that should work ever since i came here i have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress it always comes off it really annoyed me , i mean really annoying so , when i went home this weekend i bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress i have installed them and could not be more pleased i have beat the mattress ! victory is mine ! its interesting that i can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window pretty decent view tonight , i worry that i am too behind in my classes yet , i ca not imagine that everyone in the class is i mean , i do a pretty decent amount of work i bet i am about equal with most students the part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make cs in there class that is just not acceptable i have to go graduate school how hard is it to go to graduate school i really do not know i ca not be that hard or is it 11 more minutes what to talk about my suitemate just started the shower i can hear the water running i also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays pow , pow , pow that must be fun i , however , am trapped in this writing screen write , write , write like a machine now i hear jazz music i have never really met anyone who like jazz music this kind of reminds me of catcher in the rye maybe holden caulfield was just a steam of consciousness i wish i had a hunters cap to put on maybe i could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there where do they go in the winter , anyway does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something or do they just fly away , fly away ah ! i have received an instant message i ca not read it yet must type , type , type 6 minutes left , almost there nope , that is still a long time i just noticed my rubik 's cube one side is completed , the others you guessed it , incomplete maybe one day i will finish it ok , now my hands are beginning to tire 4 and a half minutes left just keep typing my neck hurts too this is making me sleepy i really want to go to sleep after this ah , that would be nice but no , i have to read lots of reading actually in fact , psychology , 1 chapter pow , pow , pow he says , missed the head what does that mean head makes me think of beer that lager has a good , hearty head nice , only 1 and a half minutes left i'm really looking forward to this being over i guess there are harder things i could do for a grade like , i ca not think of anything i thoughts a clogging because i keep looking at the clock oh wow , here we go , and i am done !
2003_151.txt 1 1 1 1 0 well i decided that i was going to go ahead and get this writing assignment out of my way actually , i was just looking for an excuse to put off my reading for my mis course i really dread reading that whenever i am finished with this because it is like 30 something pages long and i already have a bad headache it 's pounding as we speak ( or should i say as i type ! ) wow , my nose itches a whole bunch but i guess i would rather it itch than run earlier today i was on my way back to the dorms and allergies kicked in really bad i hope i am not getting sick that would really suck i am really excited and nervous all at once about this weekend i ca not wait to see devin i have not seen him in like two weeks and it is probably going to be like a month before i get to see him again he had his first baseball game today , i wonder how he did did he start did he hit well i ca not wait to talk to him tonight and get all the details i'm excited about watching him play on saturday baseball is his true love and i am really happy that he gets to fulfill his dreams by playing in college however , i hate the idea of having to come home early on sunday my reasons for coming home are good , but i just wish i could spend more time in dallas with him and not have to rush back i mean , why does the dance team tryouts have to be this weekend of all weekends every other weekend that i have been here i have tried hard to find excuses and things to do and have had no luck at all except for staying out late and partying i honestly wanted something productive to do but now that i have decided to go out of town , they decide to hold dance team tryouts and that would be what makes me nervous i have always seemed to accomplish my goals and dreams , especially in the field of dance but now i am going to be up against so many good girls and i just do not know what to do about that i really hate the idea of rejection , but if i do not try then i would never even know what would have came of it jennifer is trying out too and it 's going to be horrible living with someone who makes it if she does and i do not gosh , i really am nervous what if they do not like my style or technique i will be really depressed if i do not make it i get embarrassed about stupid stuff like this i wonder why that is it should not matter what happens , no one should care but me , but somehow i feel ashamed when i do not make things that i go out for so i just finished balancing my checkbook and i really could use some more money sure mom and dad are paying for everything , but it would be nice to go out and do what i want to do when i want to do it and not have to rely on them speaking of money , my tuition bill says that i owe 178 and that is so not true everything was paid and up to date and then i just decided yesterday to add a ballet course however , the ballet course is only 59 , , that is so not equal to 178 i wonder how long i have been writing for oh wow , it has already been 10 minutes ! how come exercising does not seem to go this fast i feel like when i am running on the treadmill that i have been going for like 15 minutes and it is actually only like 2 minutes or so that 's crazy i should not have ran the other night my legs are so sore now and walking up and down these hills many times a day has not felt good on these sore muscles not to mention , i have had 2 dance classes since then and it is really hard to be limber and flexible when you are this sore now my lip itches this music on television is horrible i would get up and change the channel but i obviously cannot do that due to this assignment i am starting to wonder about this course the lectures are really interesting and class is fun i have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part but when it comes down to it , will i really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures that sort of makes me nervous the professor is really good and easy to listen to and understand , but i still seem to think that his tests will not so much be the same way i have a feeling they will be very insightful and difficult and that stresses me out i have come from a background of like all a 's and i do realize things are going to be much harder now that i am in college , but i am not used to making much lower than an a i am getting really sick of staring at this screen and my fingers are starting to cramp my position is not very comfortable and i have not moved in like 15 minutes it is nice to have peace and quiet in here for once my roommate seems to not care or respect me much she likes to do what she wants to do and how and when she wants to do it and that is fine and all , but when i am trying to sleep i think it 's just a little rude when she comes in at like 5 in the morning and is all slamming doors and turning on lights , talking on the computer and on the phone ! it 's like , i have not been sleeping very well as it is being in a new environment and all for the first time for this long of a time , then i finally get to sleep and she comes in and wakes me up then it takes me like another 30 minutes to fall back to sleep gosh i really hate that , but we have been friends for a long time and what do you say to someone like that i wonder what my mom and dad are doing i wish i could find amanda 's keys or at least find out what happened to them i mean i just find it so awkward that they just disappeared my dorm room is not that big and i ca not seem to find them anywhere i feel horrible about her having to take 165 out of her own check book to get an extra key made everytime i think about it , i start to get the idea that maybe i accidentally threw them away whenever i took at the trash i'm thinking about sending her a check with part of the money because i feel so bad for her ! gosh this music on tv is horrible ! i like one of her songs , but she just sounds horrible in concert i do not know how much longer of this i can stand my shoulders are starting to bother me it does not help out that they were sore to begin with oh , something 's popping up i'm through !
2003_152.txt 0 1 1 1 1 right now i am watching tv i it kinda hard to type with these nails , i do not think i have had to type a large amount since i got them the commercials on tv are so stupid , especially the ones for women 's health i need to get my nails filled , but i do not think i am going to spend the money on it , there are more important things that i can spend my money on i would be nice if i had a newer computer , this one gets the job done though i just do not know how reliable , because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers , and as a result it on its third hard drive last year at the beginning of the year , my computer crashed that was not too much fun , because i had all those assignments to turn in and no computer i is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted , and how limited you feel once it is not there anymore everything seems so materialistic , but i must admit that i am just as materialistic as anybody else where my keyboard is is not very comfortable for typing got that book for my sister that is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old that must be so hard it seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class i guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well maybe that is how she and her late husband met mom 's birthday is on friday i need to get a card for her , and i need to get a card for luis i ca not forget that when i go to the store tonight hopefully that wo not take up too much time , because i have a lot of reading i need to do and write notes over what i read it is frustrating , because i am always reading and doing homework , yet i constantly seem behind i guess i have just never taken this many reading classes at once before that sucks though , because then i will have to take several sciences at once too , and that will be just as hard it is hard to get that balance , esp when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers i wish i could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner you would think that they would have more than one advisor , especially since she will or has been out for at least a month i hope that someone from health south will call me back , if not i will call again since i just got an answering machine and had to leave a message i would really like to start working again , especially because i need more hours well technically i have enough to apply for pt school , but most people have worked there for at least a year , if not more some of then have been there for three years luis and eli had been there for a year and a half or something like that well eli is not working there , because he is starting pt school i wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in san antonio i do not think waking up at 6 30 to get to work on time will be too much fun , especially now that i am in school , but i guess i just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions i do not really like not having a job , i like the security of know i have some sort of income , even if it is not a lot of course , i think school would be less stressful without a job , but i know i could handle it if i had one okay i am at somewhere around 15 minutes five minutes to go well not anymore since i typed that man i have not been typing too fast , i guess that does not really matter hey there is a card commercial i should put the stuff i need from the store on a post it i think i have some stuff written somewhere , i usually have random post its with reminders i know i have one for the stuff i need to get at home this weekend , but i'm not sure about the store i will look after i am done with this okay what next i wish i could type as fast what i can think i forget half of what i am thinking by the time i write down the first thought one minute left i wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday maybe i should go to the doctor sometime it could be what i eat , maybe i am allergic to something , or just not eating right time 's up , i guess this is it
2003_155.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i'm very tired right now i know that i have not been getting the amount of sleep that i need is this how college is all the time over this past weekend , i realized that i am beginning to get very homesick i really miss my family , friends , and my dog i started crying when i was on the phone with my brother earlier today school is getting stressful , especially with band i got a letter today saying i needed to work more on my routines i do not know what to do i have already put off so much , and gotten behind because of band i practice and try to keep up with my studies i think i really need to focus myself a little more sometimes i think it is the new freedom that is causing this i know what i need to do , i just need to get motivated to do them i also need to learn how to not procrastinate i have been thinking a lot about andrew lately , and about the church i'm still so indecisive about what to do sometimes i think that i believe and sometimes i think that i'm really not sure now i'm thinking about death i do not think there is anything i fear more than that , and what 's sad is i know that everyone must pass through it it terrifies me i would never take my own life i'm too scared of what 's after , and i love my life to much even with all of the stress i still find things interesting i am still proud of the things i have achieved i have very high goals for myself and i am so excited about the future there are so many things to look forward too why do people get depressed i have never been one to be truly unhappy even when there are times i said i was depressed i never really was it makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves i was talking to chris yesterday , and reading his online journal thing it made me want to cry i do not see how he thinks he will never find the right person , or be successful in life he is such a wonderful person , and has so many things going for him why do not people see that why ca not they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good you know that makes me think i am so obsessed with my life and what i do and the people i know i think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as i am we all live in our own world , in our own bubble , our own space i think that this assignment is pretty cool i actually do this quite often just start writing things down oh man ! i just thought of what i was writing last week , about the first football game i do not think i could ever described the rush when i marched through that tunnel it was so crazy with over 80 , 000 people there in one place watching the band march in i had the room to myself this weekend my roommate went out of town it was nice i love being with people and being with my friends , but i also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time my roommate is really nice i feel i have been blessed because we get along so well i have not met as many people as i thought i was going to meet up here well i guess i have met people , but i have not made as many friends as i thought friendships just take time though i really wish michelle was here i miss her i was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways she is always been such a great friend i respect her so much i do not know what i would do with myself if it had been my mom that is another one of my big fears losing a loved one when michelle 's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked i do not think there was one of us that did not give our own mom 's huge hugs the day we found out i was so upset , and michelle had me call everyone and tell them that was so hard so many people thought it was a cruel joke why do people do that go into denial i guess i would have if somebody had called me and told me that that was two years ago time flies so fast it does not even seem like two years only like yesterday sometimes i wish we could just freeze time during those special moments or the happiest time just make time stop even if it just added and extra minute , i think it would be nice oh look , my time is almost up
2003_159.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i wonder when my sister is going to be back from her meeting i am getting a little hungry kym 's fan is so loud , and it is making the room so cold i think i should turn if off in a second it smells like chocolate in here which is making me even more hungry i miss my cousin tabby so much being three hours away is too far i wonder what my brother is doing right now he probably has football practice i hope we win the football game this weekend that reminds me , last weekend was so crazy i do not think i am ever going to drive someone else 's car again gee that was an adventure though i think i should wash clothes later because the pile is getting pretty high why does my phone light keep turning off and on i really need to get a new one already i hope my friend likes the birthday present i bought him everyone deserves a great present on their twentieth birthday ! that new cd that i bought is great i actually feel like listening to it right now oh great i have calculus homework that stuff is so confusing it was just yesterday when i was talking to joseph and he was saying he is having a hard time in his class over at tech he said , i wonder what i got myself into and i began wondering that myself okay what was that cow noise that i just heard from my sisters computer that thing is always making the weirdest sounds my sister is so smart i wish things came to me as easy as they come to her but what do i know i'm just the middle child my brother and sister are always saying i have middle child syndrome , but what is that anyway i wonder if my dad is out of work already he always has a busy work load man i never realized how many sacrifices he has really made for our family i mean considering he is the only working parent and he has two children in college wow my dad is really smart too and what do you know my dad and sis are alike in so many ways i wish tabby would come and visit us i think it would be even better if she came to college up here too instead of back home i am really attached to her i mean we have spent almost everyday of our lives together and now i barely even get to see her on the weekends , and with college , it makes it even harder to keep in touch i wonder how danielle is doing at duke i bet she is having a ball that is her dream college and i ca not wait to hear the stories at christmas i wonder if my mom is making dinner back at home right now mmm i can almost smell it all the way over here i am still hungry maybe i should go downstairs to get something to eat
2003_160.txt 1 1 0 0 1 there is this annoying noise in the back ground that is driving me crazy it 's like a loud bell or ring i am really frustrated right now because the internet does not work in my apartment , so i feel like i ca not do much for school , which is not really good , because i am addicted to the internet my leg really , really , really hurts still , it 's swollen and black and blue it 's making it really hard to walk around campus and to do my job at work my head also hurts , but i do not know why i am still tired from class this morning , waking up and going to calculus two at eight am is very hard for me , but that is what fit with my work schedule college does not seem too hard for me , i guess it is because i am a person that likes to get all of her work done i do feel that psychology will be one of my hardest classes because it is unlike any class i have ever taken calculus will be the easiest class because math is my strong point chemistry will take a little work , only because physics is my strong point , which would make sense , since it is going to be my major the time seems to not go by as fast as i thought it would , and my head still hurts , but i think this time it hurts more because of that loud ringing in this computer lab there seems to be too much going wrong and too much to think about right now this is a very frustrating time in my life , and i just want to get through this fast enough to not cause me psychological harm and stress i think my parents have lost their mind i have been gone for a little over a week and they are having withdrawals i was just there last saturday , and they only live thirty miles away , so it 's not that hard to visit , i just do not have time and do not feel like i have to visit them all the time work is so boring , i actually dread going to work most of the time , mainly because some of the people are idiots and think they know everything , then they just screw up something and i have to fix it my advice to anyone is to not have a job in retail , it 's very stressful , especially if you are a perfectionist straightening tables and organizing clothes over and over , then watching it get messed up by uncaring customers can really drive you up the wall if i sit here and think about how i am feeling , i realize how much my body is in pain from going to the lake this weekend jumping off cliffs into water , then climbing back up does not really do wonders at all for your muscles , especially when you have none i was looking forward to moving out so much , and i am still enjoying it , but there seems to be something going wrong almost everyday not only does the internet not work , they have not cleaned our carpets and repaired all the messed up parts of the apartment it 's stressful to think about all that needs to be done , and the amount of time left time is something i hate i wish that some days had more time in them than others when i was younger , all i wanted to do was grow up , i wanted the time to go by fast now that i am in college , i want time to slow down , and have some extra time there is too much to do in so little time my fingers have gotten cold , i wonder how that happened you would think with the constant moving to type , they would be warm , but they are not i would really think mine would be warm , i type to fast for my own good now i am running out of things to say , i ca not think of anything to type my neck hurts now from staring at the computer screen this long , and of course my leg really hurts because i am sitting on it i really hope work goes by fast today , i hate the 1 to 10 shift , it 's so boring , and it makes me feel like time goes on forever time needs to fly when i am in class and at work , but slow down when i am chilling with friends or doing homework there is never enough time to do homework when you think about it , you think there is plenty of time to read this paper or something of the like , but when you start to read that paper , and work on the homework , you sometimes feel like you hardly get anything done i just remembered that i need to read the next chapter for psychology that 's what i get when i start to randomly talk about topics that are odd , i slowly remember what i need to do , but that does not mean that in an hour or so i will remember what i just did stress causes brain farts that allow you to forget something as important as homework and assignments unfortunately i get a lot of them , and that is sometimes why my grades are not perfect or close to perfect i forget little details like dates ( ok , that is not real little , but you get the idea ) and simple mistakes , especially in calculus i make adding , subtracting , and multiplying errors in calculus i can do anything in calculus , but adding and subtracting actually make me think if i do not have the calculator in front of me that makes me sound dumb , but i am not , i just forget the little things and basics wow , the time has flown
2003_162.txt 1 0 1 0 1 right now it is 11 25 i am sitting by myself in the dorm at hardin house it is raining very hard outside earlier i went to target and bought a brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack , so i got home and then had to drive all the way back i am from tulsa , oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state i love ut however so do not get me wrong , but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when i go out at night i went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged theta i am having so much fun and i love all of the girls in my sorority my friends and i have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members when i walk in the room i do not know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio also since living in austin i have been trying to familiarize myself with the area i have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting i have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants , for example hula hut , shady grove , dirty 's and much more as i walk down the drag i notice that there is a large variety of people in austin yesterday i had my first encounter with the infamous leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner also today when i went to einstein bagels i looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs college in austin is much different than my small private high school in tulsa i never knew how sheltered we all were and i am so glad that i have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real world right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk it is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus i live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place although there are many distractions at hardin house , i am so glad this is where i live i have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50 , 000 plus people sometimes it is , like when i walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium but then sometimes it does not seem big at all i have already found a group of people i hang out with everyday and i almost always see a familiar face on the way to class i am so excited for the arkansas game this weekend football is my favorite sport and i really hope the longhorns can beat ou this year since that is where all of my friends go to school on tuesday i joined a group call tag , texas advertising group , because i am trying to transfer in to the communications college i am a little nervous about that because i heard it was very difficult i am currently in the liberal arts school as an english major my classes seem to be going very well i think after this paper i am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the sex and the city dvd with my friends because they are all avid watchers while i have never seen a single episode i never really get hooked on a tv series i always just watch the show when it comes out on video
2003_164.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i wonder why they have a sticker reminding us to conserve energy by turning out the lights , yet it stays approximately 69 degrees in my room i had to sleep under a blanket today to stay warm , and i'm generally a hot natured person the thought of winter coming makes me really excited i like summer , but it just stays too hot maybe i should have gone to college in colorado or somewhere a lot cooler i do not know how some people like the hot weather so much i'm just always hot i get it from my dad , he is the same way we are similar in many ways , and we can think the same things , and know what each other is thinking without saying anything joseph was another person i could do that with , but i never see him anymore he should come down and visit , i know he likes it in austin i am surprised that i am so aggravated that my old girlfriend is going back out with an ex boyfriend she had before me i do not even live in the same town anymore , i'm 3 and a half hours away , why does it matter maybe if i had something or someone to occupy my thoughts , i would not care as much so far , i have been really disappointed with the college parties i have been to they are nothing like the ones on tv , which i know tv is not reality , but it is close ( sometimes ) i almost wish i had not brought my tv , it 's too easy to sit in front of it for hours on end i need to be out meeting people , not watching about famous musicians that make millions upon millions of dollars for being cool i would love to be a famous artist , but it 's never going to happen , so i might as well make myself as popular as possible here the more people you know the better off you are if that 's true , i'm in trouble the friends that i had down here before i moved are still my friends , but i want to find my own group i feel welcome among my other friends , but i do not feel at home i have to meet my friends on my own , not just borrow someone else 's the fig is stupid when i signed up for it , the only reason i did it was because it made it easier to get my classes lined up now they want us to do things together , and they expect us to all like each other , and want to be friends there is one girl in there i would like to get to know , but as far as the rest of them , two thumbs down i tell myself i'm going to talk to people when i sit next to them in class , but every time i end up convincing myself not to in my hometown of boyd , tx , there were about 350 students in my high school , so i knew everyone , and anything they had ever done now i'm going to a school of over 50 , 000 students no one would even know if i did not show up for a month in boyd , i would have a search party of parents and friends looking for me fifteen minutes goes by fast when you are busy i sometimes just watch the clock when i'm bored , like in church this weekend will be the best one so far i am preparing myself for being extremely social , and nothing can stop me plus , i want to be at a party that actually has some girls at it that i find attractive i'm tired of these people who do not care about their appearances dress to impress i never go out looking worse than i want people to see me as it 's hard going from being one of the most popular people in school , graduating valedictorian , and being like by everyone , to being a fish in the ocean i am nothing special here there is nothing that i can do , or that i know that someone does not do better , or know more about that has been a really humbling experience
2003_165.txt 1 1 0 1 1 okay so i'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory hall , realizing that i cannot type very well how embarrassing to keep deleting it is so hot in here and i hate macintosh comps i wish i had a laptop in my room i wish i had money my roommate brought a computer , and a tv i feel like the poor one in the room i actually decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two guests over right now they are two very nice girls but i just wanted to get away i just barely got back from houston at about 10 and i need some alone time what a weekend i had my friends tiffany , and diana and i went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called emblem281 a very renounced performance group anyway , it is a very fun group a kids and i was really excited about the audition i first and foremost am a dancer since the audition consisted of dancing and flag work i excelled in the dance portion my flag work was not bad either do not you hate when you want something and everybody says , oh you are going to make it and then you do not that 's right , tiffany and diana made it and not me it is because i do not spin rifle and i know the instructor wanted a male rifle line it is pretty sad i really wanted to be in this group that just has so much fun together but what really hurt the most is the fact that i feel i fail at everything i go for in life let 's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school i tried out for drum major and was told i would make it no questions asked i made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told i would make the all state band no questions asked i wanted to be section leader for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice came to college did not make the ballet class for my major , do not have a spot on the field for the band 's chicago show this coming game , and did not make it into emblem wow i feel a lot better it just sucks to be me right now but i always pull through with god 's help or do i just get over it my hair is starting to itch i think i should shower tonite instead of tomorrow morning i wonder why do we itch what is the explanation of an itch are the nerves freaking out and by scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down i think about the reason things happen often like why do our joints make the cracking sound something about the releasing of air or something i forget i must go to sleep soon i have to get up for dance class at 8 yeah tell me about it my mom bought me all these groceries so i do not have to worry about walking across campus to eat all the time i love her so much even though money is tight , she always makes a way for me i will never forget the strings we had to pull for my high school prom okay time has expired this little assignment makes me feel i should get a journal i just hope i have done this right ii aiming for an 'a' in the class !
2003_166.txt 1 0 1 1 1 today was just like every monday and wednesday i guess it was a little more interesting my classes seemed more entertaining than usual , although , most of them are pretty entertaining usually my drawing class at 8 am though is a little tough , just because of the time living off campus makes my mornings a little more involved than that of the typical college student i have to get up around six thirty to be able to fit my morning routine in today in my art class we did gestural ink paintings of skeletons it proved to be alright that class in general is pretty alright it seems relatively basic , although it keeps my interest the intimacy of the class size is what i like i feel like i know everyone , or at least i am beginning to feel like i know everyone unlike in this class where i know no one which really is not a problem i stay more alert that way you know , when there is no distractions i have an essay due friday and i have not started i'm not worried , although i'm not really calm about it i know ill do fine , i just do not want to be weighed down with a lot of stuff to do tomorrow i have worked somewhat hard this week well , sort of it feels like less work than high school , but then again , i feel more involved here at ut ut is really a great place i am enjoying it very much , and i assume i will continue to enjoy it in my years to come sometimes i wish i lived on campus like a lot of my friends , but at the same time i do not i mean i like the fact that i do not have to be on campus all the time like if i lived there i think i might feel overwhelmed with ut ness who knows right now i'm talking to my girlfriend on the phone as i type she wants me to come over i'm debating i mean i have a lot of work to do , and i have a feeling that it might come to distract me she is in high school its hard sometimes , not being able to see her during the day at school , but most days i just go over to her house its not that far away from mine that is probably another reason why i do not like the idea of living on campus just because ill be away from her i'm so tired its ridiculous i took a nap in the library today i have done that multiple times its proven to be ok just a little sleep in the middle of the day helps me stay awake all day something about walking around campus in the hot sun wears me out that and waking up early its funny how accustomed i have come to using this keyboard i tried typing on the macs at school and i ca not type half as fast i'm curious to know how my friends in other parts of the usa are doing i have a friend who 's going to the college of whooster in ohio and then i have another friend who is attending the university of wisconsin both very different world to that of austin i must say i am very pleased with austin no place has made me feel more at home i do not know if i'm saying just because i have lived here all my life , or just because austin is so nice i like l a a lot it was pretty nice the temperature was amazing that is the only problem with austin its a little hot but it really is not that big of a deal i kind of like it sometimes it separates the natives from the new arrivals i ca not wait for some rain or at least some cold weather i want to wear some pants i ca not seen to get myself into pants when its this hot outside although it is quite cold in the acutal buildings its not worth it too much outside time too much sweating the book we are reading in my english class is pretty interesting i recommend it its called fast food nation
2003_167.txt 1 1 0 1 1 english is my second language probably i will have a few grammar mistakes and phrases that do not make sense i have just watched a really good movie , it 's one of those movies that really keeps you thinking but anyways i do not want to talk about that i do not know what to talk about i'm having lots of reading , i chose lots of reading subjects , but i will be able to handle it it 's just a matter of organizing correctly my time the more busy i am , the better my academic results are it has always been like that if i have lots of things to do i organize my time better than just sitting there in front of the tv doing practically nothing i love that though but i prefer being busy and having lots of responsibilities this semester i'm not only taking 15 hours per week but i'm also in a student organization , in belly dance class , in intramural soccer besides from adapting to this new university freshman idea i like this task it seems pretty pointless and useless but i like writing whatever in french it would be best defined as n'importe quoi i love france i really miss that country but i do not think i will ever live there again i do not know why i have this strange feeling that i will stay here in the us i do not really want to but i know that i will end up finding a tempting work here i will marry a guy from here as well i do not know it 's just this sixth sense i have but life gives many turns life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you will get hehehehe forrest gump i wonder what tom hanks is doing right now his last movie was a couple of years ago is he doing a new one or is it just that he has retired and is dedicated to profit of what his career has left him my mother , she might be thinking a lot about me i know she misses me but at the same time , she is really happy to know that i'm here following my dreams florent when will i will be able to dump him it 's just something extremely difficult i'm used to his weekly calls and although i do not love him , i like having someone thinking of me i want a boy in austin i need a guy i like compromises and being with someone life turns easier when you have a boyfriend do not you think i realize that i'm a very dependent person not on my family or my friends but on men or a man at least if i were a man , i would have my own harem and i would be surrounded by them sounds pretty cool uh i think that in a future life i will be an extremist feminist ( if you understood that title ! ) and i will fight for women 's rights not in this life ( it 's one of this strange feelings i get ) but in a future life in this life , i'm going to dedicate myself to succeed in life what is success for me it has something to do with prestige power money i am someone who qualifies for those 3 things i will get them i'm an ambitious person i end up getting what i want we will see , we never know life is like a piano depends on how you play it i am all philosophical today with this box of chocolates , and the piano and this superficial phrases that are very commercial but are always useful when you ca not explain something like religion holy sake ! what a complicate thing that is ! how many wars and deaths that usually brings ! what a stupid thing like today 9 11 i think a lot about that and about pinochet as well but whatever , religion is the opium of the masses another commercial phrase but very very true marx and his communism ! that was about it for tonight i have to continue reading hobbes and his political system for my quiz my life is being reduced to reading and reading and reading but i like it , as i said ( and this is to emphasize it ) i like having responsabilities

2003_170.txt 1 0 1 1 0 ok so what am i doing right now this is really weird , i have never really had to think about my thoughts like this and actually record them i really do not want to be writing this right now i would rather be watching bring it on with my roommate right now man i am so tired i would also really like to go to bed right now and the sad thing is it 's only like 7 30 i really have not been getting too much sleep here i have been too busy man my whole body just hurts because i'm so tired even though i'm so tired i know i wo not go to sleep till late why do i do that man i'm so distracted right now all i want to do is watch that movie i'm hearing the scene right now and i do not even have to see the picture because i know what is happening because i have seen the movie so many times this dorm life is so different for me i'm use to being able to get away and escape in my room , but i ca not do that here it 's weird i always have someone around , whether it 's my roommate or a friend from down the hall do not get me wrong i love having people around all the time , it would just be nice every once in awhile to have some alone time and reflect on some things but i doubt that will happen anytime soon i ca not get the fact out of my head right now that i'm so tired i really should take a nap or just go to bed but that wo not happen i really miss some of my friends from back at home it 's so different because i went from seeing my best friends everyday to now barely ever seeing them or barely ever talking to them i told myself before i went off to school that i would not let this happen but it has only been about three weeks and i have already let it happen that makes me sad my friends back at home were such a big part of my life and now it seems that they are almost being replaced i have meet some awesome people down the hall and i really enjoy hanging out with them man i ca not concentrate the movie is so distracting see right now at home i would not be typing here with all this sound i would have gone into my own room and been able to focus but i have realized that in college you really ca not do that right now my roommate is blow drying her hair , that is also distracting me i need some peace and quite sometime but that rarely happens i'm so excited about the football game this weekend and the fact that the weekend is coming up i love not having to worry about classes and i love being able to relax and really enjoy myself that kind of makes it sound like i do not have a good time ever but i do i just love the weekends my roommate is laughing at the movie and i just want to be finished with this so i can watch it with her i'm really happy that my roommate and i are getting along so well i really had my doubts when i came to school with her but it has been great so far watch that all of the sudden change because i'm talking about how good it is right now with my luck something like that would happen the hair dryer started up again i really do have trouble focusing with all the sound around me the people down the hall are so noisy they play computer games till all hours of the night and yell so loud at the screen i really do not understand that nothing can be solved my yelling at a stupid screen it 's like the same idea of yelling at the t v during a football game it 's so stupid but people will always do it
2003_171.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i really do not know what to type i wonder what this keyboard is made of i really hate it when i type and i have to keep on pressing the backspace the air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it 's really cold my neck hurts what the heck is that on the ceiling was it there before i remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck is that how you would spell spit wads there 's so many words that i'm not quite sure how to spell i remember i used to hate spelling tests in elementary wow , i could not believe that i sat next to someone today in my calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class ! i had not seen him in forever i must say it really freaked me out it was hot today the walk to the business school killed me on the one hand i love that i live in kinsolving great food nice people close to the drag plus a whole lot of my classes are near kinsolving when did lisa leave it must have been around 12 i wonder when she is getting back i'm excited to go home tomorrow even if it is just for a few hours i left so much stuff there ! i mean , i would have my mom just send it to me , but if i give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room , there 's no telling how long she would search , and definitely no telling what she would find that 's not to say that there 's anything significant that would get me into any trouble but i know that there 's old notes from junior high crazy pictures from those crazy party nights and who knows what all else man , that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason i definitely hate timed tests such as the sat 's for starters i hate the fact that it 's a standardized test secondly , i hate that it 's timed and above all else i hate the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores now i know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants however , some people are just not good test takers me ! in school i can study , understand , and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes but going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous see , look at me when i start talking about tests and intelligence scores i try to make coherent sentences in other words i try to make myself seem intelligent enough of that what else am i thinking about i ca not believe that i am actually in college it sounds so clich , but i can remember just yesterday when i was in elementary school how my biggest concern was who i was going to play with after school or what time recess was it was great being a kid that 's not to say that i do not enjoy the freedom that i have now , but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility i have my mom on my mind and i think that 's what made me type that sentence i just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what i was thinking at that moment i would think of something and then type it now my hands seems to just be flowing , my fingers just seem to be hitting keys that 's weird to me for some reason well i only have a couple of minutes left to me , 20 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts , i figured i would not be able to do it but here i am this chair is so uncomfortable it 's so hard and so wooden at least it 's not a big , soft chair because i would never get anything done i would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read reading something that is my downfall i do love to read , but making sure that i have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story ouch something just bit me and i'm a little curious to know what it was probably an ant , is not that gross ! we have ants in our dorm room !
2003_174.txt 0 1 1 0 0 okay , let 's see i'm really really stressed out right now over calculus i feel like i am doing so horrible in it i made what i consider to be a pretty crappy grade on the homework that was due last night , and all it was was a review i got a 75 7 the homework before that i got something like an 85 3 my goal as of last night is to make a b in the class for the semester i'm really worried about it though because i really have been studying hard and it seems as though the hard work is not really paying off i just need to find some people who know what they are doing to study with and do the homework with that would be nice , but i do not know anybody the only other class i'm seriously worried about , ironically , is this one , psychology i do not know what to expect yet all i keep hearing is about how hard it is i love psychology and am really interested in the material , but i'm still extremely apprehensive i guess i'm just worried i'm going to do really bad or something i want to have about a 3 5 gpa or higher i do not rightly know how that whole scale works , so i'm not sure how hard that is to do exactly i'm just so stressed out it seems this weekend was my birthday and all my friends wanted me to go out and do things , and that 's all good , but i actually wanted to stay home and study i really have been worried i have not been really social either i'm normally a fairly sociable person , or at least i think i am , but lately , i have just been studying on top of that , i never really make much effort to meet the other girls on my wing , or go out with new people , or even meet that many people in my classes or anything i have to admit that i have made a few friends , but i guess i had some preconception of my coming here and just being bombarded with cool people and making really awesome connections i have not really done that yet i still get depressed and my eating habits , though better when i first arrived , are starting to diminish fast what really sucks is that i have found out a way to binge and purge here as well i was hoping that living in a place with a communal bathroom i would have to stop all that , and that it would be a great leap for me in my recovery , but i have found a way it 's horrible i see myself slipping more and more each day , and the old thoughts of how easy it would be are starting to come back i really do hate myself so much sometimes i feel so worthless it 's like in calculus , i have been working my ass off and i'm still doing shitty i do not have any friends , i do not have any self esteem , and i have horrible social anxiety it 's so bad sometimes it 's been worse lately like today , i feel fat and ugly , so therefore i do not look up when i walk , i do not make any attempt to talk to anyone and when they talk to me i have to pretend to give a shit and be perky , whereas i feel so pressured to say something of meaning or something funny or something that 's even remotely interesting that i end up saying less i just hate it i have nothing to be afraid of , that 's what they tell me , but that 's just the way it 's always been i hate being alone , and though i'm not really depressed , or at least not as much as i have been in the past , i'm just so damn lonely i just want someone who i can talk to and laugh with and do things with it always seems as though i have nothing the only thing right now in my life it seems is my education and i work and work and work , and even then it does not pay off or at least that 's how it feels i know what i am doing , i know what i am , and i'm trying to conquer it , and i have been doing damn good all things considered , but it 's just so hard sometimes i'm going to try and go to a rush function tonight at the business school for alpha kappa psi i'm overwhelmed with anxiety i know i'm going to have to get drunk before i go otherwise i'm not going to have anything to talk about or even talk to anyone it 's so horrible there is no difference between me and the person i am when i'm wasted except that i have no inhibitions and i'm not afraid to be myself i do not think about what they are going to say or think of me if i do this or that it 's still me , i just ca not be me unless i'm like that when i first meet someone all my friends like me for who i am , but most all of them i met when i was drunk if i had met them sober , maybe we would not have been friends thinking about how i'm typing this makes me think it does not make much sense , but it does in my head , and that 's all that matters here right i'm pretty sure that 's the point it does not matter if someone else can read it and make sense out of it , it 's just that i know what i'm talking about aaahhhh ! i feel so frustrated i do not know what to do i'm worried about the thing tonight , i feel fat and ugly , calculus is depressing me , and then psychology is just scaring the shit out of me i hate the way i feel it 's as though everything is bearing down on me and i do not know how to control it i can carry the weight , but i am having an extremely hard time and i do not want to be carrying it i wish it would just fall off i just need to calm down and be more focused my goals seem so hard to attain at the is point help
2003_175.txt 1 0 0 0 1 i hope that this is not a big deal , as i have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner if i get graded on content or grammar , i'm simply done now i have been caring a lot about my grades so far and i'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like georgetown or columbia i actually miss nyc a lot , but its a nice change down here and i'm happy to get out of connecticut i do miss my family a little , but i think they are doing fine and i will be seeing them in no time i'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in vegas come october still ca not believe we lost in the state semi 's to crappy amity that one kid was really good though maybe playing at ut will be just as fun and we will have success seems like texas lacrosse is nothing to ours , but i should not get cocky yet its only a club team nobody better come in my room even though the door is open do not feel like being social , and its late its annoying that dumb mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds in fact , mark is annoying in general he seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here , but he reminds me of mendelson at home so much i do not do well with these leech people too , i wish he would not follow me around but you know what , he is a really nice kid and i feel terrible saying these things , especially in some assignment that someone is reading at least i'm nice to him in person waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either ah he is awake , he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does bah its funny coming to college after you are used to your friends at home i'm glad that i do not know anyone and i'm on my own you get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well , so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit i think i'm meeting decent people though and i only expect to meet more and more cool people at first i was pretty skeptical about everyone , but that 's just because i was missing the guys i have had a good time with for years time to move on plus i always said i needed to get out of little lame brookfield zebrahead is the bomb i do not think i ever get tired of their music i would like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they do not really have any dates posted and if i do see them again , i'm going to chill towards the back and just listen being up front was crazy , but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin but hey , its the price you pay i suppose radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though , hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding its horrible i know , but its really not cool what she was doing plus , she was not seriously injured girls should not crowd surf anyways , there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel haha like that one guy who ripped the girl 's thong off speaking of which , i need to meet some more girls here emily has completely drained me over the past two years and i'm glad that i can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people i do like that one girl in astronomy , she seems pretty cool its too bad i do not see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor , they are all pretty private i do not see what tyler and jeremy and luke see in the girls upstairs too , they are just really loud and annoying , and not the most attractive of ladies either you got to love ut , there are attractive girls everywhere ahahah to whoever is reading this , i apologize for sounding like a complete jackass i have talked about dropping girls on their heads , and how i think people are ugly , and how i do not think people are too cool , and how texas lacrosse is not very good i probably sound like one arrogant loser i'm really not but i do admit that i am very confident in myself , and i think that rubs off on how i express myself actually , i'm probably just pretty arrogant 311 is the best again , the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts i wish i went to see them in concert here last week , but i have seen them before and i had class early the next day live music is the best i think seeing stp and cake here the first night i visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me , that was pretty tight there 's a whole lot to do here , i love it last night at sixth street was pretty fun too even everything just seems cool here i'm drawing a blank here just listening to music maybe i should i have left it off when i started writing yep drawing a blank again wonder if cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet , he is going to have to start writing this too , and i bet i will have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room okay , my 20 minutes are up , and i could continue if i wanted to , but i'm pretty tired so i think it would be best for me to just hit the sack , or play counter strike
2003_176.txt 0 0 1 1 0 my room seems nice , i mean it 's not like home or anything , but the privacy compensates i wonder what mom and dad are doing hopefully we throw the surprise party for mi tia juany but anyways , my roommate is making noise by the mirror it 's sort of irritating how she just takes control of the tv when it belongs to me and i turned it on i simply left downstairs for 5 minutes and i come up to see her lying lazily on her bed with my remote changing the channel , just surfing the channels when i wanted to watch the my show anyways now that that is out i can continue yeah , my roommate just told me the milk carton is spilling and now she is cleaning the refrigerator i went back home last weekend i bought a couple of books which i want to read , but seem to have no time to do it i have a ton of class reading well , biology seems like it 's going to be easy , chem a little work , nutrition just pay attention during class c c a lot of reading my roommate always eats late at night and i'm trying to help her get better eating habits , but in my opinion , she is not really willing or up to getting on a diet or losing any weight her brother called tonight and asked to talk to me or something along those lines this is the second time someone has called for her and she then hands the phone to me , like i want to talk on the phone with them i do not like talking on the phone i should probably tell her not to hand me any calls unless i'm doing absolutely nothing i do not like to get distracted especially if i'm watching tv , or doing some kind of school work she ( roommate ) just finished informing me right now that the washer and drier are 75 cents yeah , i have not done any laundry since i got here but i can still manage with what i have in my closet i really need to get some organized all of my books and and papers well , it would help if i got all my book first i'm missing one coincidently it 's psy , i went yesterday and they have no more hopefully by tomorrow they do i need to go over there after class thank goodness i only have one class tomorrow i have to finish my ch and c c homework , shower , check mail , write my tuition check red robin , i worked there an entire year last year , too much work for not enough money my roommate was my superior there , but i worked as well as she did , and many of times better ( simply because the team liked me better ) it 's funny that reminds me of the time they were wishing me luck coming over here living with her do not get me wrong my roommate is a great girl i have known her since 5th grade i like her confidence the way she can just talk to someone and say what 's on her mind yeah , they are calling her up to ask her to work this weekend , i'm not working there until the break yeah , this time around i'm registering for my classes early , so i do not have closed classes like this semester but i have to admit my schedule is pretty cool this semester , having to move a lot of things around well time is almost up so later
2003_179.txt 1 1 0 0 0 so before i started writing this , i was eating some reese 's cereal this cereal is so good it tastes like chocolate and peanut butter and the best part about it is that it is a cereal and that means it 's not that fattening that 's always good but since i ate that , i'm kind of thirsty basically , right now all i want is some water and that 's kind of not letting me think about anything else i'm also thinking about last night i'm not sure if this guy likes me or not but he keeps leaving subtle hints about it but he flirts with a lot of girls so i'm not sure what to think about it and i'm still not quite over someone else so i do not know what to do but it 's kind of something that gives you acceptance into a crowd of people especially snotty people like indians tend to be initially which sucks i wanted to come to ut to have some indian friends but this whole process of struggling to fit in is really hard and like we learned in class , this is definitely a down time for me i really miss my family i wonder what they are doing in california right now i'm sure dad is at work but mom must be so lonely without her daughters and her friends and her work i hope she is not sad and is finding something to do with her time my mom is the most wonderful person in the world she sacrifices everything for us i mean , my parents sent me to ut despite all our financial hardships that is so nice of them to do that and slightly selfish on my part but i think i will be happy here once everything becomes a lil routine and i meet all the people i'm going to meet at first , it seemed like i would never meet anyone and i was really depressed about that too i'm still really hungry and i definitely need some lunch i really do not want to go to calculus today i'm kind of tired of not feeling like the smart person anymore like i was in high school this is definitely a rude awakening which is not fun i'm definitely a worrier like the girl said who read my hand yesterday i worry about everything i worry about not doing good in college which means not a good job which means all in all disappointing my parents that 's the saddest thing for me because all i want to do is make them happy also , i have to do good so i can stay here and i can already see that i will not want to transfer to another school after this year especially after i join kphig those girls are so innocent it 's insane it makes me feel almost like i know too much or something and i do not like that i guess that 's why you should save yourself for the right person so you do not have to feel that way in an extreme way which thankfully i have not done but now i know ankur did i ca not believe he did i guess i really do not know him like he says i do not i wonder what he really thinks though i mean i think he used to like me but i guess he just sees me in a friend light now maybe he never even did like me and he just liked to talk to me when we were younger but how do you lie that to much to a girl in e mails and everything i guess its possible if you can stay wtih a mentally incapacitated girl for over a year he is just such a nice guy and i guess it was one of those childhood or actually teeny bopper fantasies of being with your first serious crush forever or even it might have had to do with the fact that ankur was the first indian guy i had been wtih and like that is a huge deal because there were no indians in south carolina and i really want to marry an indian too either i'm marrying an indian or i do not get married at all because no other race can understand us i mean yesterday at our sisterhood party there were talking about how much hair indian girls have on their body that is so awesome no one but an indian girl can understand the strife of that it was something that dominated my thoughts for years when i was growing up and i did not have any indian friends to share it with and now i can finally relate to girls i think that is the primary reason i want to join kphig and plus it adds to the acceptance factor and you have immediate friends which is awesome that 's definitely work done for you sometimes i wonder if dilen 's happy he sometimes seems a lil down but i guess he is happy hanging out with white people cause he does not fit in well with indian people it still makes me upset though to think that he has to face comments of him being gay i just do not see it and he is not gay so people need to just calm down and realize not everyone who likes shopping and is weird around girls is gay
2003_181.txt 1 0 0 1 0 i am writing this for psychology class i'm glad it accounts for part of our grade because i am nervous about the difficulty of the class , and i know this is a completion grade i really really want an a , but i read the professors pick a prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be there is so much reading , i do not know how i can keep up with it there is a good song playing on my computer right now , calling you by blue october the class dj should play it in our class , even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology , but it does not seem like much of his music does yesterday in class , when he walked up there to put on his music , i made a comment like 'oh no , here we go again' , and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me i felt kind of bad i do not know what psychological value can be obtained from this i find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this now an incubus song is playing , its a slower , relaxing type song called echo everytime i hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me and for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball i have no idea why , the song has nothing to do with volleyball that seems to happen a lot , when i read hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly , for no apparent reason there was this book i read by dean koontz , i ca not remember the title ( i read a lot ) , and everytime i read it , for some reason i would play the staind cd in my head i think its probably because the book is sort of dark gloomy , and all of staind 's songs are depressing and miserable i do not know why i like them so every time i hear a staind song now , it reminds me of that book i always picture the book cover i remember it was a really weird book , about these creatures called from some abyss of hell by some voodoo guy , in all sorts of shapes and sizes , and they hunt this guy and his family no matter where they go they always get in to the buildings through the ventilation system i can still picture them hissing and scratching at his kids dean koontz is a pretty good writer like that he is good at making the strangest things real enough to you that you can picture them the only thing i do not like about his books is that they are so predictable this is how they always go there is always a strong , independent main character , either strongly in love with their spouse or single the main character also either encounters or owns a playful , intelligent dog i think dean koontz really likes dogs , usually labs the main character then comes upon some problem tat he she ca not really help but to fight , because its affecting them in some way for example , one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him , one lady had a psychologist ( haha ) using hypnotism to control her and several other people , giving them bizarre fears ( hers was of herself , one guy had a look alike twin of his out to kill him just weird stuff so on the way of fixing the problem , the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey , or they fall even more in love with their present spouse and it always ends happy therefore i no longer read dean koontz books i know what is going to happen after i have read the first chapter now a song called i stay away by alice in chains is playing the guy across the hall in my dorm downloaded it for me because he said my taste in music needed improving it is good lets see , 3 minutes to go dr pennebaker keeps mentioning in class that we freshman should be feeling depressed confused at this point in our lives it seems like he is trying to make business for the mental health people that he mentioned i personally am not overwhelmed at all by this college thing it seems just like high school , for me at least i was always pretty independent did not rely see my parents much and you do not really notice the big classes i still go to bed wake up at pretty much the same time we do have a lot more free time here , because your life is not so structured , but i think out of habit i am structuring it myself 20 minutes are up , goodbye

2003_185.txt 1 1 1 0 0 ok , at this very moment , i'm am in pain , emotionally yesterday , i had a bad experience i saw my best friend kiss the girl that he knew that i had a certain attraction too it really really hurt , but i have gotten over it i ca not really get mad at either one because first of all , we meet the girl at a club on saturday night sunday morning and two , my friend is a little more wild and social so he was talking twice as much than i was the girl called me herself last night , but i told her that i did not want to talk to her anymore because i had lost interest in her as for my friend , he told me that he was really really sorry , yet he has not come up to me yet to show his forgiveness i'm ok with it , i just do not understand how something like this could happen i'm in question though , i do not know if i should be mad or not i think of one way , which is that i should not let something stupid like this ruin a long , good friendship between my friend and i , or , if it was right to begin with that my friend kissed the girl that i liked after i had told him that i liked her n e ways , good thing its all over and i'm moving once again with my life i try not to let this things interfere with my everyday school life but at its impossible to keep them apart for example , i could not concentrate all day yesterday because i was thinking of what had happened i did not read , i did not do my homework , which is a very very bad thing the good thing though is that i got over it and i'm back to normal i guess its just one of those weird once in a while incidences today has been a much more productive day then yesterday i went to go see what color band i would get for the ticket raffle of the texas vs ou game unfortunately , i got the pink band , which is the least likely to have a chance to get a ticket no worries , i was not really planning to go to that game , i just went to get the band because two of my friends asked me to go get it i have a glow in the dark stars type of theme here in my room i had never had the chance to have some in high school , so i finally did in college , and i just noticed that one of the very big stars fell off and is on the floor i am looking at it this very moment , wondering why i'm not getting up and putting it back in its place i also have the glow in the dark feet my roommates , who are like really cool back from home friends say i'm a dork for having the stars , but none the less , i could careless on what they have to say because i think they are dorks too , haha i see some dirty cloth on the floor and in that pile of clothes is my work shirt with i just happened to remember that i need to wash because i'm going to work tomorrow dang that a nice car , i just saw a blue bmw pass by , very very nice car tonight , my roommates and i are finally going to go shopping for groceries its been a while since we have gone to buy food another thing i just remembered is that i need to clean the kitchen , its my week and i have to clean the pig sty ( kitchen ) i got a ticket to go to the texas vs arkansas game and i had not realized that it was this weekend my roommates and i were going to go home this weekend , but i ca not go anymore they are still going , but i'm not i'm kinda sad because i wanted to go see my little nephew and stuff , but there is nothing i can do about it now i'm stuck here in austin i told my mom about the situation and she got kinda sad , but i told her that it will mean more the next time i go down typical hispanic mom , she told me that i should of not made any other plans if i knew that i was going home , but that was the catch , that i did not ' know that the game was the same day that i was going to go back home so what is going to happen is that i'm not going to go home after all and i'm going to the game with my friends i just remembered that i was going to ask one of the ta 's where sea is , but guess i will just have to figure that out on my own n e ways , my 20 minutes are almost up , after this i'm going to hit the sack and take my usual 1 30 nap and wake up , clean the kitchen and go buy food c ya

2003_188.txt 0 0 0 0 1 my computer is spiffy i decided to name it mara , which means bitterness apparently , but i was naming it after a character in the star wars books who is really cool my computer gets in fights with a friend 's computer we type to each other over aol instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other she named her computer screwtape after a demonic character c s lewis developed it 's hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up , i'm on to a new thought i'm also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because i hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes however , i probably wo not be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because i am typing so fast one of my friends is iming me , but i ca not respond because i have to do this for an entire 20 minutes i'm only at 4 minutes 50 seconds right now i guess i can keep him waiting he is one of the best friends you could ever have however , i'm having a little trouble right now because he and i are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and i know she still adores him completely besides , i think they are much better for each other than he and i could be he and i are both too proud and arrogant she is proud , but she does not think she knows everything she is pretty zany i met her back in the 6th grade and we have been friends ever since our friendship has had its ups and downs , but it has never halted i just could not hook up with her ex boyfriend because that would be tacky , at least for the next couple years i know she had be really upset and i could never forget the way they were together fortunately , i think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me speaking of romantic interests , there 's a boy who lives next door to me who 's pretty attractive however , i think a lot of girls are attracted to him , so i would have a lot of competition , and i do not like competition he seems like a really nice guy , though i'm thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot one of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party , and apparently he came i was locked away in my room , attempting to study because i have a quiz and a test tomorrow ( actually later today , since it is now after midnight ) i wish i could find a guy who was not so emotionally messed up or low in the self esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away speaking of which , chris has not e mailed me back he and i got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation , though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going so anyways , right now he is avoiding me i wish he would talk to me , because he is one of the few people i trust to be honest , moral , and to steer me from harm and i need to talk to a guy like that right now i seem to attract guys who are not particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people the irony is , they like me , they tell me , because i'm so moral , pure , and sweet someone 's knocking at the door it took only 30 seconds to answer it my roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab she is really cool , probably one of the best possible roommates i could have she is quite eclectic she likes to knit , particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy if i have enough energy , i fidget during lectures i used to play with a hacky sack in high school some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it it was cool , because my teachers trusted me i even was friends with a few i went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago i'm going to miss them speaking of which , i need to e mail mr karnavas , my former bible philosophy greek teacher
2003_189.txt 1 0 1 1 0 well this weekend has been really different i guess that 's because it was the first actual weekend that my friends and i actually went out and explored austin i know that we have been here for two weeks already and have not explored austin , but i think it was better this way the first weekend we did not want to go home and deal with all the emotional issues that we had dealt with just two weeks ago it was also weird this weekend because not one of our friends was with us she had in a way made new friends , which is alright with me and everything it is just that she was trusting them as soon as she heard that they wanted to go and party in austin what was really scary was that last night my friend went out with these girls that she has only know for a week and they went drinking at some party i do not mind the drinking issue or her not hanging out with her old friends from high school , it 's just that she was leaving austin ( the party was in san antonio ) and the driver said she was not going to drink a lot i was kind of in awe that my friend left with people when the designated driver was even drinking i feel that even if the designated driver has at least one drink than that person should not drive i guess that 's what this whole college experience is all about people are responsible for making their own decisions here no one is here to tell them what to do and no one should these people are adults now and can think for themselves i also know that another reason i did not want to or even want to go home until i really have to is to deal with the emotional issues of leaving my family , especially my mom i know that i'm close to my father and my younger sister , but it seems that every time i talk to her on the phone or when she came to visit last thursday , i felt like i needed to cry i do not know why i felt like that i know that we are very close but i really do not want to deal with that issue of me not being able to let go of my childhood and become that adult that my parents have tried to raise me to be i also have another worry on my mind one of my guy friends had be accepted to the university of houston and he was rooming with my best friend 's boyfriend and according to them , everything was great my guy friend had been dating this girl for the past four months now and she had helped him move in and settle and this past summer they had spent , from they told my friends and i , nearly every day together or if they were not together , they at least had talked to each other one the phone for a couple of hours to me that sounds kind of like they could not leave each other alone or trust each other but i do not know if that would be normal because i have not really been in a relationship like that well to continue with my worry , according to my best friend 's boyfriend , our guy friend had been kind of sad about missing his girlfriend ( she is going to the university of north texas in denton ) every time his girlfriend would call him , he would get sad and my best friendn 's boyfriend would try and get him out of the room and go around the campus , and he would be happy , however as soon as she called , he would get sad again and of course we all understood that him missing her was normal well the university of houston started two days before we did and that monday night our friend had been talking to his girlfriend and was mad because he had missed her well apparently she gave him her credit card number and he took a plane flight to denton and he told my best friend 's that he was never coming back what we do not understand is why he decided that this is his first relationship and they already have given each other a promise ring or a promise gift because she gave him a realy expensive watch with a diamond in it and he gave her the ring what my friends and i do not understand is what is going on through his head well my time is almost up i have like ten seconds left so i guess that 's it
2003_191.txt 1 1 0 1 0 today is a bad day my boyfriend and i of 2 years just broke up because he is at another university and is rushing right now i have always been the center of his world and now he acts like he does not even want to talk to when except for when it is convenient for him his roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me and when i first heard that i got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the restroom jared , has been the ony guy that i have ever loved and i thought i would marry him we spend holidays together and i am already a part of his family and he is part of mine to think of him being with someone else just kills me and i am so torn up right now that i cannot concentrate on anything but him i had to end it because i cannot continue to be hurt when all i have done is devote my whole life to him he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had together my thoughts are horrible right now and i never thought that i could feel so hurt and ashamed my biggest fear is that he wo not even care because he will just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other girls jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he was always worried about me forgetting about him he was always the one that could not stand not to see me for one day , and he was so in love with me tat sometimes i got annoyed by it now the tables have completely turned because i feel like i am incapable of functioning without him for the past 2 years , everything has been about him and so now i just do not know what to do with my time where do i even start without him there to say i love you at night , or without him there when i am having a bad day this is the worse feeling i have ever felt and i just wish he knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day ! he will probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks i helped him move into his new apartment and was not invited to come since , but all of our friends have gone over there and seen him , so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that position i have not been real happy lately as it is because i just transferred to ut and i hate it so far i do not see anybody i know during the day and i feel so lonely without jared , and now it will be permanent this is the worse time for this to happen and it makes me feel sick when i think about how it probably wo not change we have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now there is nothing perfect about us and all i feel is pain he is going to the school that i did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while i have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what i get for it ! i kept telling myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about him every day i am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help me during down times like this , but they have never seen me like the way i am today i have seen other people hurt this bad and i just thought to myself that it must suck to be like that and now here i am in their shoes he is the guy that has always put a smile on my face , made me feel loved and made me a better person i go to sleep at night thinking of him and i wake up in the morning thinking of him we have had problems before and after a few days he could not stand fighting with me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad i keep telling myself that if we do not talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me , but i have such a bad feeling that this time is different and he will just move on i do not want to move on but i have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people because when i think about it too much , it tears my heart up this is the guy that i have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has already given me up we have all the same friends and i will not be able to hear about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until i start t feel better i have no energy and it scars me because i do not even want ot do my homework of study because my mind is in such a different place right now he has put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting people it just kills me to think that i am here and he is there without me because i have always been included in everything he does now all of a sudden i am shut out and i hope he realizes that he ca not live without me it is so hard for me to think of him with somebody else because i know everything about him and what he likes and does not and i do not ever want another girl to be that close to him i love jared so much and i wish he would not have ever left or that i would have stayed there because things could be different right now , but he enjoys making me jealous when he talks about all the things he is getting to do i know that i must just live day to day knowing that things will get better but right now i ca not see myself getting over this for a long long time i feel worthless today , am i am a very good person so what did i do to deserve this i am just hoping and praying that things can be patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is like without each other i just do not want him to throw everything away , because he is the best thing that has ever happened to me i talked to him this morning and all i could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as i do i am only wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if i will ever be on his mind because i usually know what he is doing all the time i am supposed to be the one who goes to these parties with him and i am supposed to be with him when he meets other poeple so they know that i am his girl and now all these girls that have been in love with him while we have been together are going to love that we have broken up i am going on and on about how upset i am its just very hard because i had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being without him and as for school , i hope it gets better it will just take some adjustments i hope jared still loves me as much as he always has !

want her to , she did not listen to me , how rude she never listens , just constantly does what she wants , and complains if she reads this now , she will be understandably upset we moved down to texas together from northeastern university in boston and its been more stressful than i had imagined i was the impetus behind our transfer and feel some guilt whenever she does not enjoy something , and constantly want her to have a great time , even though i share some of her misgivings although i have to say the campus is great , the school is good , and i enjoy going to class however , ut did not match up to my expectations its a tier one school and i expected more , i can detect little difference between here and northeastern , except northeastern has more money do we compare our writings at the end of the year and look at how are thoughts have changed as we have become more integrated into the school i hope not , i hope there is some more interesting point to this class or maybe , this class will give me a greater ability to analyze the writing which will lead to a deeper understanding of my self my girlfriend is so stubborn she takes so long to come to the obvious conclusions she ca not study because of the loud girl with the annoying voice and i told her to go to the library and i would join her in twenty minutes , but no , she would rather suffer maybe she knows i feel guilty when she does not enjoy something and wants to punish me in some way , or maybe she just wants to be near me or maybe she is afraid of change i heard yawns signal the body is preparing for a change in action or state of being , maybe that is accurate , never heard that before and it does not occur in all situations i did an internship at northeastern and i hated it , that made me focus a lot more on school i was always disorganized and rarely put effort into school , after that experience however , i want to get the best grades i can and the widest range of academic experience i feel that the more ways i learn of analyzing a situation , the more thought processes , the better i will be able to deal with the real world and whatever i want to do mostly right now i want to be a trader , a hedge fund manager , be wealthy predominately to have security and independence not have to worry about work and do whatever i enjoy i think that would be economics , write essays on economics , and that ties in with trading and hedge funds , so it is not far i also am interested in politics and think about running for congress this paper clearly alters my thought process , i do not lay myself out every time i think , it has an artificial quality to it although , in class you said one way to deal with depression and change was to right about it , maybe this homework assignment is a self help exercise how come women care more about the personal life and thoughts of other people than men , in general , not every woman i assume that someone else wants privacy and to be treated with respect but women always want to know what is going on and pry into it people are interesting to watch though , but there is a lot of commonality in all human actions people tend to do similar activities , not exact activities , but similar groups of people tend to act in similar fashions that loud girl left , its so much quieter here i do not know when i am going to graduate , but ill have 87 credits after this term , and six months of an internship experience , crazy at some point i need to graduate , that will be exciting but nerve racking i'm mostly worried about paying bills and saving for retirement and college for children its insane i worry about that , i'm 20 , not 40 but being interested in finance makes me think about that now , and how important the first few years in and after college are since money in the stock market will double roughly every 7 2 years on average , its important to start early for retirement what about all the people in less developed countries , specifically third world countries we should do more to help them , humanity only has itself to support it , we should not exploit each other i wonder what the world would be like if people were able to look beyond the immediate future and into the next 10 20 years they would see its in their best interest to help those less fortunate ending slavery and instituting a minimum wage has caused real wealth to increase , not decrease and society is more stable imagine how much better the world would be if everyone had a stable society , could go to college , contribute to humanity and become consumers there would be more technological advancements , real wealth would increase faster , i'm sure we would find new problems , but things would be better i'm not sure multilateralism is the answer , institutions do impinge upon our sovereignty , but they are better than a single hegemonic power trying to control the world there are not any attractive girls in here , besides my girlfriend i wonder what that says about the business school atrium at 6 o'clock on a wednesday not a happening spot perhaps although there a ton of people here for the cash flow casino 20 minutes , sweet , i can do other homework see you friday

2003_194.txt 1 0 1 0 0 ok , so i am supposed to write about what i am feeling , hearing and thinking all that , so , the trucks outside my window are driving around backwards for some strange reason and the beeping is really a pain it starts at 7 30 or 8 00 in the morning and the beeping goes on all day long my roommate wants to know how much work those trucks can actually accomplish when they are driving backwards ! lol , i agree and would really like to know , all i see when i look out my window is a big whole in the ground , not to much progress but i am sure the construction will be moving along slowly but surely oy veh , i have not typed in such a long time , i have gotten so slow i am just like my grandma , new technology drives me nuts my computer , phone , everything , too confusing ! i like having no alarm clock or phones or computers or anything , but its all just part of america i guess , so along the lines of beeping , the door to my floor is beeping again , the alarm has gone off every time someone goes in or out of the door it 's all part of dorm life i guess , luckily i can sleep through anything so it does not really bother me much , just when i am trying to study but that is why we have libraries i am a little worried though that i wo not wake up is there is a fire drill or something my roommate ( i wonder how you spell that room mate roommate or roommate ) anyhow , she will wake me up thank goodness my suitemates just made dinner even though its late and it smells yummy ! i think it 's pork though so i will have to miss out on this one it 's amazing the things you can cook in the microwave these days ezmac seems a little scary but most food turns out pretty good i really miss my moms cooking , i think that is got to be one of the hardest parts of being away from home , the food and the fact that me family would always eat together it 's so quiet here i can tell the weekend is winding down friday and saturday nights are so noisy and something is always happening now its all hush hush i have only been typing for nine minutes and i ca not believe how much random stuff i have thought of i took a yoga class today with a friend , i had never taken one before and somehow you move around for like an hour and come out of the class feeling like you just took a great nap for the whole time the instructor played this awesome music ( the only word i can think of to try to describe it is zen ) , it was happy and sad at the same time very interesting i have taken up going to the gym because it is about the only past time that lets me avoid my school work and procrastinate without feeling too guilty it 's a great excuse , so to the gym i go it 's fun though , i made friends with all the crickets that live in and around the pool i have never seen such big crickets before in my life , only in pinnochio and stuff like that , they are huge here , it 's like they are on steroids or something bugs are not my favorite but i guess they can enjoy swimming too i want some popcorn , ya know , like the really good but really bad for you movie theater popcorn how come everytime someone pops a bag , it seems like everyone in the world can smell it ! yum ! so , my walls are covered in post its , i always need a reminder for something and my room is finally starting to look a bit lived in , the walls are so bare and the rooms are so boring i like things bright and busy busy busy ! my roommates favorite color is pink and her whole side of the room is light pink , which just happens to be my least favorite color , i think that may have something to do with me never wanting to hang out in my room , it 's really awful she is awesome and we get along perfectly except for out choice of color so i really am lucky but anyhow , it 's amazing how a color can affect your mood so much ( or at least mine ) i really wish i could type faster mas rapido ! i have not used my computer hardly at all , i got used to living without technology this summer and i loved it people here rush all the time , we need to learn how to take it easy and just enjoy everything that is around us we are so silly even though we pride ourselves with being so advanced , i think we just get caught up in it all and forget how to take a break and chill i am tired of thinking , i have been doing it all day , i wish i had a switch to just turn my brain off for a few minutes my roommate just walked in , she opened the door and i jumped , now she is looking for her key , what a bummer to lose that or an i'd , your i'd is like your life here , ok , well , my time is running out , hope you enjoyed reading what all was floating around in my head ! wow , done at exactly the right time woo hoo !
2003_195.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i am thinking back to when in class you were talking about sitting in front of the computer and wondering what to write about i wonder what my roommate is saying hmmm for she may think it is weird that i am writing about her if she reads this i like rice krispie treats i just had one i went to the vegas getaway for the business school it was fun my face is itching my nose , then my neck i really like what i have done with my hair today , but too bad it took longer than i had expected it to take my roommate , erika , is leaving she is going to go get something to eat now my back is itching i wonder why , when you itch , simply rubbing on the itching spot does not make the itch go away you have to scratch it instead would not it be easier if we just did not itch at all i mean , what 's the point of itching anyway i guess it just makes the experience of life all the more interesting also why is it that when you start to itch , you suddenly itch everywhere kind of like when someone yawns and you see it , it makes you have to yawn too , even if you are not sleepy i'm spending an awful lot of time thinking about itching i want to take a speed reading class at the utlc maybe it will help me in the future but will i begin to speed read everything if i take the course i like listening to music i guess most people do really my nose itches again i'm glad it got cooler in this dorm room last week it was so hot i had to sleep on top of my blanket the good thing is that it therefore provided more padding on these rock hard beds i really like the movie chicago it 's so theatrical speaking of which , i think my sister had auditions for the high school 's fall play today i wonder how she thinks she did i hope that she gets a part , even if it 's a small one i'm looking forward to seeing the fall production maybe they will make it to state oap this year i miss being in theatre i would like to join a theatre club , but i'm not sure i have time for the rehearsal commitment plays are a lot of work i really like this writing assignment you all have devised for us it 's interesting and even kind of fun i like the box i have on my shelf it 's orange and gold , with a leaf pattern thank goodness i only have 2 classes tomorrow today was nonstop 4 classes with only a 30 minute break i had a bagel for breakfast i wonder how early the bagel guy has to get up in order to go to his little stand and be open in time for 8 o'clock classes i wonder if he likes his job he would get to meet and see a lot of people every day that , i'm sure , is a perk or he would not be living in austin , or any big city i'm from a small town austin still continues to wow me with the massive number of people on campus and on the streets oh good i get to put my pennant that i bought today up on my board in about 5 minutes it cost 7 one about 1 3 of the size cost 6 they are probably betting on the idea that people will not check the price of both pennants and simply buy the smaller one , thinking it will cost much less i had economics today i think i'm beginning already to think more about the economy at least i hope so , because if i am , that means i will do better on the tests there is a study session tomorrow night that i will be attending i need to go running later i'm really glad that the gym is so close by in my hometown , you had to drive 35 45 minutes just to get to a gym so it was either waste all that time , or go run on the hard , uneven , gravel y , county road gravel y is not a word but that 's okay i wonder what psychological experiences you all will get by reading these assignments 5 seconds left oh okay my time is up but i get to finish my thought i'm going to go study now i have to read my psych book for your class tomorrow
2003_196.txt 1 1 0 0 0 humm this is very different from anything i have had to do before my finger really hurts right now because i cut it last weekend , pretty deep too , i probably should have had stitches but i did not now i'm going to have a scar on my finger tip and it really hurts to type anything , especially on this keyboard because i'm in a computer lab i'm not used to this keyboard , i like the one on my laptop but my room mate is asleep so i ca not really hook it up right now i wanted to just plug the internet into my laptop somewhere else , but i could not find anyplace , i tried the port in the study lounge but it 's disabled then i had trouble getting on a computer here i do not have an if account because i'm in the business school , they just gave us the logins for that and i have never needed anything else i'm just glad my friend came along because he logged on and let me submit this i'm kind of tired i have not been sleeping well , i'm used to sleeping from like 8 00 in the morning until like twelve or one in the afternoon this weekend i did not sleep friday night , and i partied saturday night and did not go to bed until like six in the morning on sunday i slept like nine hours then though because i had been up for forty six this week has been weird hours too sunday night i slept for like two hours , that was not bad , my body only needs like five hours of sleep or so before i wake up and ca not go back to sleep anyways , two hours sunday night , then i got four on monday night , none on tuesday night , and then about three and a half last night now is like 4 30 i think , the clock on the computer says 3 39 but i think it 's wrong because i thought the clock on the wall said like 4 15 when i came in from smoking a cigarette mmm cigarette sounds like a good idea but i have to study some more after this the sleep schedule that i have is kind of weird with classes in the morning , but i have been doing a lot of studying lately i hang out with my friends during the day and then study with a few of them at night tonight it was me and my friend cimu and kenchi studying , cimu went to bed at like 3 30 or so kenchi is here now thank god or i would not have been able to do this until the morning when my roommate wakes up she goes to bed at like 11 30 and sleeps until like 10 00 in the morning i do not understand how a person can sleep that long , i can try to go to sleep at a decent hour but it does not matter because i have to lay there for like an hour and a half before i fall asleep then once i finally do get to sleep i only sleep for like four or five hours , i just wake up , not to go to the bathroom or anything but i ca not ever go back to sleep i hate it when my alarm clock has not gone off yet and i wake up if it 's just like ten minutes before its set to go off , i do not mind but when i wake up and there 's an hour and a half or two hours left to sleep and i ca not go back to sleep it sucks then i just have to lay there and be board when i could be studying at least i found some other people that like to stay up all night though shaun is really cool , the other night we stayed up the whole night because we were not really tired he likes to sleep during the day but i just do not like to try to sleep we hung out earlier in the day and then studied all night in the lounge beside the jester desk we could have gone to a study lounge i guess , but we both have laptops and

2003_198.txt 0 0 1 0 1 ok , ummm , i'm hungry just got out of psych class and i was hoping to go home , but must turn this writing assignment in before friday the lie detector presentation was interesting sadly i started nodding off around the part where dr pennebaker was talking about dopamine and schizophrenia and parkinsons i was never completely asleep , just in and out of consciousness man , my typing skills are really sucky anyway , ricky 's in my head he is turning 19 on september 24 i always think he and chelsea should be together because chelsea wants it that way wanted she says she is over him , but i do not know i am excited about the garlic toast i'm going to make with andrea 's tuna casserole yes , my roommate is also andrea she is the more prominent andrea totally super smart , super pretty , super nice i could totally jealous no , envious because she has what i do not have , she is not taking what i used to have yeah , i could totally envy her , but it 's just not so she is a blessing so i need to make a bracelet for jodi hopefully she is doing ok and why is kirk still in my head we were not even super friends , just very casual acquaintances , but he manages to pop back in my head after three years great job kirk actually , i think i like thinking about him or the idea that i have of him i do not really know him so i can only entertain the ideas that i have of the hypothetical kirk and i feel old and worn out and everytime i'm close to the edge of the sidewalk and a big bus passes by , i somewhat regret that i did not fall or stumble into its path i'm not suicidal , but the drama that comes with saying or writing these things is fun i could die so easily if death came right now , i would go with him even more so if he was cute but i have too many people to be responsible to not just friends and family but everyone who i have told that life is good where am i going with this i do not know but it 's more interesting than an itchy foot , no so biology is making me feel anxious hard professor , dr edmiston , but i like it that way because it 's like a battle or a contest you get through , if i get that a , then it 's going to be so cool because it 's such a hard ass class andrea 's hardass class is physics , but hers is plan ii so it 's probably triple the intensity of my biology class i'm glad i have something to work for , something to worry about because it was too easy at uta ( arligton ) i was not' challenged so i slacked off worked more and got more money , yeah , but wasted time and money on classes that i liked but were not going towards nursing oh well i tell andrea i feel like a gray crayon here in austin but i do not feel that all the time , just when i realize how gray i am compared to others i'm thinking of what to type so this is probably only partial stream of consciousness , and not because i have something to hide but i'm better at writing my thinking and writing speeds are almost the same or , that 's not good , i can slow my thinking to my writing speed but not to my typing speed and i just want to go to sleep and not wake up an eternal darkness , but i would not know because i would be asleep but then if i ever wake up on the other side i would feel guilty leaving people behind so that was twenty minutes yeah , if you want to see more stream of consciousness just ask to see my blue notebook i usually sit front and center and no more than three rows back but who would care but it 's there ok , bye !
2003_199.txt 1 0 1 0 1 well , here i go writing a stream of consciousness i am starving right now all i have eaten today are cookies and queso with chips the timer clock at the top of this page is bothering me , i do not know why , but it is distracting me from writing my boyfriend is going to his ranch tomorrow i wish he did not go every weekend because it sucks for me to be here without him the electric bill is so expensive that we received today i am out of money well not out , but out of money that i can spend on random stuff i miss my mom i hope my grandpa is doing ok , he is very very sick my eyes hurt i do not like wearing my glasses the fan is also irritating them i am glad that its the weekend i want a cool front to come through i am so tired of being hot outside at school i think i have a obsession with correct spelling i know that this is supposed to be informal , but i cannot let a misspelled word go uncorrected capitalization does not bother me , however , nor does some punctuation i am the same way when i type online to my friends i wonder if that means anything significant probably not i want a dog i wish i lived in a complex that allowed pets next year i will get one , hopefully i want to adopt one from the spca or the pound they are just as nice as ones from breeders , as well as cheaper , and they need a home more than the others geez , this timer makes the time seem to go by more slowly its like that saying my mom always says , 'a watched pot never boils ' similar at least i want a good book to read i hate how i have so much reading homework from my classes that i do not have time to read for pleasure oh well , maybe i will find the time once i get more settled in to the routine of school i need to do laundry i have no clean clothes to wear , and i dropped grape jelly on my favorite jeans yesterday i hope that it does not stain i do not know what to day now its so weird , i know that the brain never stops working , but if you try to identify your thoughts sometimes you draw a blank its like you caught your mind off guard like when your boyfriend asks you what you are thinking about , and its really only what you had for lunch that day , but he is expecting something more romantic than that because he thinks he is being romantic and sincere by asking the question so maybe when you have to say immediately what you are thinking at that moment and you do not have an answer , maybe your subconscious is just embarrassed because it was just thinking about something insignificant ok , that whole little tangent probably made no sense to anybody except myself oh well i am tired of typing my hands are out of shape how sad my whole body is out of shape i hate living on the third floor of my apartment complex the stairs are killing me i did not realize how out of shape i was until i had to move in and carry all my stuff up a million flights of stairs my chair is too low and i ca not figure out how to make it go up higher because there are not any knobs or levers its hurting my wrists well , my right wrist to be specific i hate it when people have something they want to say and they just do not know how to be direct about it 'beating around the bush' that is so annoying just get the words out mmmm i am so hungry i want a burrito or some queso or both at the same time i love mexican food its good stuff i would like a margarita too that would be nice i hope that i can transfer into the college of communications that would be awesome i hope that i succeed in advertising i think that i would do a good job , but there are so many good and creative people at ut , all wanting to do the same thing as me i hope that i have a fighting chance i know that i have the work ethic to do well , but as far as creativity , i am uncertain if i measure up to the industry standard wow , the time is up that went by fast
2003_200.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i am sitting in the library i wonder if my typing will bother anybody wow , my typing speed is not very good , especially on this non ergonomic keyboard i really hope that no one will examine my spelling and grammar on this assignment if they did i would look pretty dumb i do not seem to think in complex sentences , or at least i do not when i am in a stream of consciousness o wait , there was one i found some humor in that when i run i try to run for 20 minutes just like the amount of time i am typing for time goes by slowly when you run and type did you ever have a sister did you something about sitting hear and dialoging with myself makes me think of the sound and the fury maybe i am just trying to be pretentious by making it appear as though i think with a great deal of profundity good word matt hopefully i spelled it right and used it correctly some one is talking in the library that is not kosher sarah use to always say that i miss her sometimes maybe not romantically , but she was fun to be around i wonder where my romantic life will take me in the next few weeks so far i have met a lot of girls , but none have blown me away hopefully there is one out there that will my mother is dead she really is i think about that a lot i think about that and emily an awful lot they both sorta dominate my inner dialogue i have gotten better about it lately i am growing , healing , and finding other things to put in my life to replace the thoughts of them , well mostly replace the thoughts of emily i do not want to forget my mother i ca not forget my mother , or else my life will get fucked up i must learn from her mistakes and understand that i will naturally view love from a female perspective like i had love from her i have to be careful should i really be this honest right now should i not censor myself really , what business of yours to be in my head right now you can make me do homework , but can you really make me tell you all the crazy stuff going on in my head not that i am psycho , but there 's a lot going on in my mind all the time and i do not feel like anyone really gets a glimpse of that , much less some random professor with whom i have never had a real conversation ten more minutes left what more do you want i am tired i would say i am stressed out but that bath i took in the dark a couple of hours ago really relaxed me my mother taught me that it is very healthy to have positive ways to relieve stress like baths or sodas as opposed to anything else its much better to chill than to just blow up at someone so how exactly can you grade this should i make my comments more profound should i release some of the beautiful poetry of my mind on this computer screen who am i kidding man , that guy looked pissed people are so damn easy to read some time learning how to be a good poker player may be the single greatest skill one can garner from any form of competition i mean , you always are sizing people up , separating the wheat from the chafe , taking smart calculated risks its beautiful i am starting to get really sleepy staring at this screen i am very sleep deprived i am very sleep deprived , and i do not know when the hell i am going to catch up any time soon either being a pledge is kinda rough very time consuming man , this last weekend i got no sleep friday saturday and sunday i was busy as hell i did not really even have time for psy 317 my eye itches i scratched it five more minutes i think i am starting to feel a slight headache coming on this is awhile to stare blankly at a computer screen i need to relax ok now i am typing with my eyes closed wow i actually typed that ok my typing is not that bad wow having my eyes closed is nice really very relaxing , much like that bath i took i love the dark , especially when i have a headache now i am starting to chill out again pretesting looks like it might be lame if i have to stare at a comp for so long what is that girl looking at i do not know what to make of a library i know what to make of a bedroom or a nursing home they both have really clear feelings that radiate from them not really this place is concentration a feeling cause if it was that would be the color of this place another poetic comment by yours truly just call me thoreau or elliot i suppose call me ishmael even i should read more its fun , it sticks with me , i just do not have time for it often

2003_204.txt 1 1 0 0 1 ow i just hit my knee on the table and it hurt i bump intot stuff a lot i think that it 's because i do not pay much attention or maybe because i'm trying to pay attention to other things and the other things consume my brain until it 's full and there 's no time to think about the wall in front of me i ramble a lot too and i do not mean to the light in my apartment is still broken i have told the people at the management place and i do not think they care they definitely do not care about the bugs living in my kitchen my knee still kind of stings these lights are really bright inn my eyes , and i would turn them off , but then my computer would go off because the power wo not flow through the lights unless they are on which is stupid what if i do not like having the lights on what if i'm one of those crazy people who sits in their place doing nothing , not talking to anybody and having no contact with the world and this light is disturbing my peace because the only way i can have peace is to be completely inn the dark all the time good thing i'm not like that i do not type as well as i wish i did my aunt types really fast and brags about it too i forgot to send this insurance bill to my dad , i hope it 's not overdue i already scratched the car too , so he is probably not too happy with me right now , even though he would not say he was not happy with me he is always so why did not he get mad when i told him i scratched the car it bugs me sometimes when people do not get mad when they should like when i messed up the sherwin williams breakfast coupons and kevin did not yell at me he is too nice he probably gets mad behind my back , and that is worse he is fake and i do not like fake people give me reality or give me nothing , because fake is a load of crap , and crap is never good that girl in my freshman seminar is so horrible she is fake if i ever saw it she actually smiled at me today when i know for a fact that she despises me she really does , just because i have strong opinions and happened to say one of my opinions about baptists not even anything bad about baptists , just that they are phonies , most of them i do not know why she cares , she not baptist or even a christian she does not know what she really thinks , so she tries to pick up opinions that are not hers and make them her own only she ca not back them up because she does not really believe them and they are not really right anyway she is wishy washy and i do not like that either believe what you are going to believe and the hell with everyone else who cares if they do not like what you are saying , because you like what you are saying and that 's just who you are hiding who you are is not true to yourself they will eventually find out what you really are and what you really believe anyway , so who cares if it 's now or later i like sharing my opinion i even like it when people get mad or offended i do not know why , i just think it 's funny lots of people get offended easily natalie sure did have an awful look on her face that one time i ca not believe she was scared of me , that 's so stupid she was afraid i thought she was stupid boo hoo , who cares what i think anyway we were friends for years and suddenly she is scared that i think she is dumb of course she is dumb , but i would never tell her that , and i certainly never did anything that should have made her feel like she is dumb i think only strong people can handle me that 's ok because i only like strong people anyway weak minds make me sick not stupid minds , but weak minds minds that don 't know or do not think or do not care about anything , because what 's the point if i ca not talk to you i do not want to know you private school you had to hang with people you did not like you sit by yourself one day on purpose and they all flock around to see if you are ok yeah , i would be okay if you were gone , but you ca not say that because they would hate you and you would never have any friends because they would tell everyone what you said and then you would be evil , god forbid god forbid anyone has a rough day and just wants to be alone , away from the fake laughs , fake jokes , stupid people i hate stupid people i'm sorry , i'm a mean person i do not mean to be that guy sitting next to me was killing me with his breath today in class he is fake to i hate when people ask me how i like austin so far why the hell do they care anyway everyone has the same generic response and the same bla bla bla bla bla answer , i hate asking people stuff like that so i do not and i expect people to return the courtesy but how would they know that i hate that they do not know me there 's no way they could know or they could guess , but no ones too good at that i am so tired that customer service guy was nice i wonder if he is cute he is probably a nerd what do i mean , probably , probably definitely he is a nerd computer people usually are my friend hit on me the other day i do not think i have any guy friends anymore all of my guy friends keep hitting on me , which sucks , because then i feel weird around them are they really friends or are they just trying to get some who really knows for sure i think all guys are sick like that all of them are jsut totally , totally , sick , they ca not help it they ca not just be normal , they have to go screw things up
2003_205.txt 0 0 0 0 1 right now i am thinking about the point of this i guess maybe it does have some point but i really do not see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment i mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes my dorm room is rather hot and i want to get up to turn our fan on but i wo not because then i would have to leave the computer and then i could not track my thoughts for those few second that i leave the computer i waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 9 45 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me i also notice that i have only been typing for like 2 minutes i wonder what i'm going to be typing for 18 more minutes gosh i have some much to do tonight i have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and i have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that did not get saved for some reason and then i have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions i do not really like my biology class but i do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and i have done well in it so far my ear is starting to hurt i hope i do not have an ear infection i feel like i'm starting to get a headache maybe its because i'm tired or maybe because i'm hungry or maybe because i'm dehydrated i dunno but once this is over i think i'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what i'm thinking of i have been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why i have a headache who knows but i ca not wait till i get to go to sleep so do you guys actually read these i bet these can get really interesting i mean if i had to read over 500 of these i would probably be pretty bored but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts , hundreds of them is it stimulating i'm dating a guy who a psych major he is in grad school right now mastering in something pysch related he is supposed to call me right now maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff my jaw is aching right now too i have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad i wish i could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful but anyways and its only been like 12 minutes this is crazy after this i have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because i know that i will be tired and i wo not feel like doing it an then i will tell myself that i will sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what i need to do but it wo not happen gosh i'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but i think it might be from my jaw and that probably why i have a headache gosh i really could go for a massage right about now but i do not want to spend any of my money my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet what a dick ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes i doubt that this writing assignment , aside from a simple grade , really benefits me in anyway so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments hmmm i do not know if i like that idea but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that i will have to do but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when i close them i want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well i only have like a minute left count down 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 5049484746454443424140393837363534333231302928272625242 ah nice its over

2003_210.txt 0 0 0 1 1 today i had a fairly busy day i believe as i am feeling a bit tired right now i wonder what time it is oh it 's 9 14 p m right now so i guess i can continue writing this assignment haha i'm just kidding i feel good about myself right now because earlier today i helped somebody out who needed it she is my sister 's friend , i guess an acquaintance for me , and one of the tires on her car got a flat she and my sister both did not know what to do , so my sister called me and i came and fixed her tire for her after that she bought my sister and me dinner as a way to say thanks i feel better now than i used to about a week and a half ago because i tried out for the marching band here but i did not make it i was really depressed for a day or two because i have been involved with band for the past seven years of my life in high school and middle school but after awhile i began to realize a few of the benefits of not being in band for example , i do not have to buy those stupid white plastic shoes all the members are required to wear so i can save some money also i have a lot more free time than i have had in a long time it feels really good to be able to take long naps in the middle of the day without having to worry about practice at 6 p m in the evening and interrupting my sleep man , that timer on the top of the screen is going really slow it says it has only been eight minutes but it feels like twenty already my wrists are beginning to hurt i want to listen to music on my computer right now but i ca not because my roommate is on his cell phone talking to his friend and i know my music will only bother him we do not share the same taste in music in fact , i think we are as far as possible in our tastes in that category i think these chairs they give us for our dorms are very uncomfortable i mean , they are completely wooden with no cushioning at all you would think that in the honors dorm we would get special treatment of some kind , but so far i think we are being treated the exact same way as the freshmen who are going to drop out at the end of the semester it 's hard to concentrate right now because i usually need music to help me concentrate i like the upbeat kind of music that has a constant bass drum playing really loudly on all of the down beats i also like classical music and music that has drums and stringed instruments at the same time i'm not sure what the kind of music is called , though however , i do not like oldies or country music at all in fact , i hate that kind of music that 's why my roommate and i do not share the same tastes he likes that kind of music i just heard somebody running down the hall of my floor at a really high rate i wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 9 30p m maybe he was running to get more beer for the party just kidding again no need to get investigators up here or anything but earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people , so something was definitely going on i was thinking about emailing that dj guy for our class i do not remember his name , though i have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class , and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and does not think he is he thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him ok ! i only have one minute left after this , i think i'm going to get ready for bed because all this sigmund freud type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy i think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than i thought i was when i first started typing this
2003_211.txt 0 0 1 0 1 my stomach is really full from the waffles and breakfast sandwich i just finished eating i keep smelling this minty sensation everywhere that i go right after i finish this i have to go to thursday 's website or pollstar to see when they are playing a show in san antonio i feel slightly uneasy school is starting off to be surprisingly easier than i thought it would i have to find a way to get more shifts at work so that i can continue to pay to go to school here there 's this band called brand new that rocks i have been listening to their cds for the last month non stop , they are coming around here in the next couple of months and do not know if i should go or so just save my money then there 's this girl who i ca not stop thinking about she is my ex girlfriend and she treats me horribly , yet i ca not stop myself from wanting to be with her a couple of days ago i went and watched thirteen ( co written and directed by a ut grad ) with my friend lydia , who i had not seen in nearly two months i know that every teenager on earth thinks that their life is the hardest and most complex thing to deal with , so i will try not to complain about mine my life has been pretty good , i have always done well in school and stayed out of trouble i do not really party very much , i do not smoke or drink , which i get a lot of crap for considering one of my friends is the president of the hell raisers people come up and tell me about their problems or i read the paper or watch the news and realize just how miniscule my problems really are i'm excited about the experimentation part of this class and hopefully i will have time to sign up for it after i'm done with this but , we will see lately i have been acting really weird and doing things i would not normally do i started working out on a regular basis , which was always something that i tried to avoid with all my heart i'm saddened by one of my favorite rap groups , bone thugs n harmony , who have hit an all time low they have gone from selling out the erwin center in '96 to opening for the insane clown posse and stubbs bbq the saddening thing about that is that icp are the worst act to ever grab hold of a microphone it 's not possible to think of anything more painful than listening to one of their songs it 's people like those two idiots that make me lose faith in mankind and the fact that there are people who actually listen to that filth religiously is seriously disheartening i think i have to go to the bathroom , but i got to wait until i'm done with this and i have checked on thursday then i have to make sure that i do not have any tests scheduled for the same night as a concert i already have one conflict on oct 30 , when taking back sunday will be rocking the masses whilst i whittle away taking a math test hopefully i can get done with the test in time to hustle over to stubbs and catch their set , it 's a highly anticipated one and they should not let down

2003_220.txt 1 1 0 0 0 writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time , but i have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health so , maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal i'm listening to music right now while i do this and it is actually kind of distracting me its for my history of rock music class which is actually kind of boring , but i heard its going to get better as i write this i notice how incredibly bad at typing i am other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 20 minutes i am going to have like a couple of paragraphs that is really sad now , i am thinking all psychological though i am like oooooh , they are going to read this and think that i compare myself to other people i do compare myself to people all the time i am very competitive my arms hurt already i do badly on computers i hate staring at the screen when teachers make you read articles off of the computer , i always have to print it out which is kind of annoying i also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when i am not thinking about making it good i am kind of surprised i made an a in rhetoric i loved rhetoric it was really interesting for me all my classes this semester seem interesting tough but interesting geology is weird hopefully it will get better i found out today that i could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking psychology 301 i am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically so i am sad , but psychology 301 will at least be a good introduction and now i sound like a suck up because this is for psych 301 and now i sound like i care about what people think i do though to some extent ooooooh fun song on that swing swing song by all american rejects i like it a lot it reminds me of the summer i wish i would have seen american pie three i did not even see the first or second one though haha my room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here she is strange and different , but she is really unique and i like her a lot she is never here though her boyfriend goes to a m just like my boyfriend she always goes to their games and never has even been to a ut game ! i told her she should come to the arkansas game with me and she was like oh yeah ! we played them last week ! we we she said we as though she was from a m she is crazy my boyfriend lives in college station and you will never find me there there is nothing to do so , he comes to austin i realize i have pictures of people in my room that i do not even like i only have a picture of this girl jenny because she is really good friends with my boyfriend she and i are cordial to each other in person we hate each other really though i know she hates me a lot my boyfriend told me i hate that she hates me because i am usually nice to her but , i hate her too but she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy so , i think i have the right to not like her wow , twenty minutes is a long long time i still have 8 minutes left and i feel like i need to do something else maybe that means i have add i cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading i am behind in all of my classes i study and read i just have to take breaks and re read a lot cause i do not catch everything like i try to keep up , but i ca not its bad i need to study more but then i stress myself out if i do not do anything but study i need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period i stress myself when i study 24 7 that is how it was over the summer everyone else went to frat parties every night and i stayed in and studied there were no organizations to be in there were only frat parties and i do not even like frat parties all the time drunk people can be fun sometimes but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming and plus boyfriends do not generally like that so , i stayed in and studied i was so focused on my grades that i would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85 because i was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once , i stressed out so much that i threw up it was really bad all of my friends were really worried about me i passed out and everything over a paper ! yeah , that is pretty scary i guess i am just not good with my time management i do not know something is really messed up with me i think my boyfriend thinks i could use a counselor but if i see a counselor i probably will not have time for activities besides school and that would not give me anytime to not think about school which is what activities do for me i like that i am doing them i hope i make lassos i am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more we shall see
2003_223.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i can overhear the sound of my roommate watching television right now he is watching sesame street , it is a pretty funny show to watch for a little while every now and then the muppet characters are quite ridiculous i am kind of hungry , perhaps i can cook some bagel bites after i am done with this writing assignment last night i went shopping at target to get items for my dorm room me and my roommate ended up spending a ton of money , but everything we got is going to be very useful over the next few months living in the dorm today has been a very relaxing day , as i have no classes on thursday the program on television just changed to barney and friends , they are singing the song the noble duke of york , i remember this song from my youth , my mom used to sing it to me when i was young i had forgotten the song until just now when barney reminded me of how the song goes damn , i just finished my dr pepper , and there are no more in the refrigerator i guess i will have to put more in when i'm done with this children 's programming is so ridiculous , it seems like they are not trying to teach the kids at all but rather try to impress certain things on them well my roommate just turned of the tv so no more children 's programming for me i guess now i am listening to tomahawk , a very good band , i went to a show of theirs a while ago , it was the best concert i have ever seen it was them playing with the melvins and dalek i think dalek is playing sometime in austin soon , i want to go see that show too dalek was alright but not nearly as awesome as tomahawk or the melvins i feel kind of hot , we need to get another fan for our room i bought this printer a few days ago from the campus computer store and it did not come with a usb cable , so i could not hook it up to my computer what is the point in having a printer if you ca not plug it into anything so i had to go back to the store and buy another cable the campus computer store really pisses me off with their horrible service i was thinking about how a person blind from birth could have no comprehension of sight i think it would be cool to make a movie about this concept too bad i do not have the means of making a movie i think i could make some really interesting movies if given the opportunity but i am sure most people think the exact same thing , everyone thinks their own ideas are the greatest ever this led me to wonder if there are other sense which are superior to sight which are just as hard for us to comprehend as sight would be to someone who has never seen wow tomahawk is really good band , i had not listened to their new cd in a long time and now that i am listening to it again i remember how much i like them i wish i had more confidence in myself i have no real reason to lack confidence , i want to be more confident but it seems everytime i am put in a situation where i would need to display confidence i choke it seems like it is my body 's natural reaction to get nervous my brain sees no logical reason to be nervous yet my body makes me choke up , its very frustrating oh well , its not that big a deal , i think my confidence has improved greatly over time el cordobes ameniza el espectaculo una brillante banda de musica

2003_228.txt 0 1 1 0 0 today has been an absolutely great day , except for the weather austin has extremely crazy weather one minute , it was bright and sunny outside , and the next it was raining cats and dogs ! of coarse , it continued to do this for the rest of the day now that i am in my dorm room , i am beginning to think about what my mom and other friends are doing it makes me a little sad to think that i am here and cannot be with them normally , i do not get homesick , but for the last couple of days i have been missing everyone extremely i am sure that they are all having fun where they are , but i feel sure that they must miss me too i just got done talking to my mom , and she said that it is very sunny down in corpus christi right now i miss the excruciating sun that comes along with the cool breeze there now , my roommate just walked in , and i really want to go outside because she let some hot air in it is so cold in this room our thermos stat is in the room across the hall from ours , and the girls in that room will not change it they keep telling us that it is so hot in there room , but i cannot stand it it is so cold in our room i always walk around with a blanket in corpus , it is never cold , not even in the winter time it truthfully only get down to about sixty degrees in the winter it 's crazy ! i bet my friend frances is having so much fun at ole miss she calls me every couple of days in corpus , we were very close , so for her not to call me that much means she is very busy and having a great time i wonder a lot about how all my other friends are doing another one of my best friends just started at princeton i hope she likes it i know her classes will be hard i do like it here though i am just beginning to make friends , and i think as time goes on it will get easier and easier at least , that is what everyone tells me i went to draw for a football wrist band today my number was terrible there is absolutely no way that i am going to get tickets i wish i could have though it would have been so much fun ! i am not a big football fan , but because ou is such a big rival , it would have been exciting ! gosh , it is so cold in here i feel like my fingers are going to fall off i hope the rest of the year it is not going to be like this my roommate is now studying so i will have to be quiet for the rest of the night , but that 's ok i just go outside to talk on the phone or downstairs to watch tv i believe that is what i will do after i finish this assignment because i really do not have much more homework to do actually , just kidding i have a big economics quiz that i need to study for after i am done oh well another fun filled night of homework this school is much more difficult than my high school i miss the simplicity of high school it wsa so much fun ok , my time is up so good bye
2003_229.txt 1 0 1 1 1 well , i do not really know what i am thinking right know actually i think that i am a really slow typer and that i really need to read for all my classes , but i am just too tired to do that right now my desk lamp is really bright and it hurts my eyes unless it is facing down i am really excited about tonight because i am going to the chi o pledge retreat i hope that it is fun because i do not really know any of the people in my pledge class and i want to get to know them all i like all the decorations in my room that the actives put up for me the red and yellow balloons are starting to look bad so i think i need to take them down now i think that i will save them so that i can make a scrapbook later with all of the chi o things that i have acquired i am really hungry right now what do i want to eat i am tired of eating mexican all the time which is really weird because i love tex mex oh well , i really think this is a weird assignment i keep getting on weird subjects i think that i need to get my nails done really bad , but i just do not know when i will find the time to do it i should probably check on my laundry i wonder what we will do tonight at the chi o house i am not looking forward to putting on a swimsuit i need to find some dance classes to take so that i am doing something active and not just sitting on my butt all the time i am really thirsty i ca not wait to go buy all the tops pictures i took this weekend i miss my sister and i think that i might go home on the weekend of the 20th my ex boyfriend 's birthday is today ! i wish that i could see him well maybe i can finish the roll of film that i have so that i can get it developed before ashley 's b day on wednesday i think i hope that kyle does not get to hh soon oh well , my back is starting to hurt from sitting in this chair i hope that my to heals well i can not sit still i really like the chi o things written all over my mirrors in red and yellow my stomach is so hungry i seem to have a bigger appetite now that i am in college that is probably not a good thing i really hope that i do not gain the freshman 15 um i need to call my mom or just send her an e mail with all my book costs on it so that she can call dad it is about 5 30 and i have to be at the chi o house at 9 00 should i look cute i bet that some people will get dressed up , but i just really do not care when is kelly going to get back so we can go get food i really like the posters that we finally received to day , which took forever to get here they add character to the dorm room i wonder who i am going to live with next year i hope that ashley does not feel left out when she finds out that i am going to live with lexi and kelly next year and who knows who else i mean she could always room with us i guess , but i think that she would not have as much fun because she never wants to go out with us she just stays home and studys , which is fine , but it just seems like she would do better somewhere else i do not really care i guess that can be left up to her
2003_231.txt 1 0 0 1 0 i ca not believe she did that she is supposed to be my suitemate , and my friend she knows that i like him , and i thought i could trust her with my secret thoughts on him why did she have to run off and tell him everything i have said in the past 3 weeks what kind of friend is that did she think she was helping the situation the question that i have been asking myself for the past few days is , how do you know when you can trust someone why ca not people mind their own business in all of my years so far , growing up with gossiping girls has not always been easy , but i always knew how to keep a secret if someone ca not trust you with their secret , how do you expect to trust them with yours there was this old saying my friends and i used to repeat in junior high , secrets secrets are no fun , secrets are for everyone secrets secrets are no fun , unless you let me in on one ! how true is that i wish i could just take back everything i have said to her , knowing that she has run her mouth to the last person that needs to know my secrets i can feel the tension between us building up slowly when she asks me a question , i can hold back my answers because i still have some resentment towards her sometimes i even forget that i am supposed to be mad at her , and to make things worse , she does not know that i am mad at her mad is not the correct word to describe my feelings disappointed makes more sense i met her through a mutual friend 2 years ago at a concert in houston i thought that would be the last time i would ever see her , and those 15 minutes of conversation with her are blurred now when our mutual friend informed me that she was attending the same school as me , and living in the same dorm as me , i thought that we should be suitemates and try living together at first , we hit it off surprisingly well , doing everything together it was like we had been best friends since elementary school ! we are even rushing the same sorority can anyone tell me they have been in my difficult situation before well if you have , please write a manual for me to read on how to deal with lying suitemates friends that you thought you could trust what bothers me the most is that she does not know that i know what she is been doing behind my back everytime i would make a comment about the guy i'm into , or hang out with him and come back to my room glowing , we would sit down and talk and gossip about it why did not i see it coming why could not i have known that she would betray my trust and run along and tell that guy everything i have been gushing about it does not make any sense to me , because i have higher expectations in a friend than that i expect a friend to respect my secrets , my wishes , and my personal life that does not involve them i guess it 's partly my fault for not watching what i say around her , like talking about things that i would not want to get back to him i guess it 's partly my fault also , for trusting in her too fast my roommate has been very supportive of the whole thing she told me to just watch what i say around her , and to not say anything that i would not want anyone else to know it just hurts my feelings that she would gain my trust and then knock it down quick to the start maybe i should not be so open with people i barely know maybe i should not feel guilty , because ultimately it was her screw up right
2003_232.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i have a campbell 's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder ( a tribute to andy warhol ) and i am watching it now my desk is a bit cluttered purses , markers , papers with assignments that need to be done , a dr pepper can i am unsure what to write i began a painting today , and did not finish it my dorm does not feel as though it 's a creative environment , but i suppose the dorm wo not change so either i have to change my perspective , or not paint at all my eyes are heavy , and i am cold , because my hair is wet and squeaky clean my hands are warmer than usual ( they are usually as cold as ice , or very near as such ) , and i shall have to remember to tell my mother , because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating it is ten to midnight my mind is active , but i lack in motivation i am excited about this new life i have , as a college freshman , but i am also extremely nervous i must do as well as possible this year , so that i wo not have to return back home to a run of the mill local college ( as my dad has threatened if i do not succeed in producing a pretty looking gpa ) , and also my future as an architect ( the career which i would like to pursue ) is depended solely upon my performance this year i did not get into the architecture program this year , and should like to transfer in as a sophomore i have run out of things to discuss i miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home i had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that i have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat i brought only the bare minimum of books with me , my art books , of course , and my absolute fave novels , one of them being a wrinkle in time i am fully aware that it is a young adult novel , and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite , but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless my room smells of the body wash i use ( energizing citrus , i love it ) and stale mr gatti 's pizza there is a faint tinge of acrylic paint smell my roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit my bed is full of pillows , two black hearts and a red furry one , and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me i am , for once , not hungry but merely satiated , as i feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger i have less than seven minutes to go ! i wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo in what way do you benefit from reading this i ca not imagine how anything could come of this , except perhaps extreme boredom , or maybe resentment there is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend 's subdivision in georgetown , holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such , and every time we drive by her , i think that has got to be by far the worst job in the world she stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on , holding a bent sign and a jug of water and i can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is i am a pole yes , ladies and gentlemen , with one simple gesture , a stick could be stuck in the ground , and the sign pasted onto it , and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job , and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up , and it just kills me and i am glad i am not her i am glad i am not a whole bunch of people the end
2003_233.txt 1 0 1 1 1 today i had to wake up for an 8 00am class i am so tired right now , but i'm not going to take a nap because i have a lot of things to do today last night was my roommates birthday she had a meeting that she had to go to from 6 10pm , so we could not go out to dinner instead , when she got home , i had gotten a couple presents and she opened them she started to cry , telling my that it was the first time anyone had ever celebrated her birthday i find it so strange to find out about the different types of childhoods and life that all of my new friends here have experienced everyone comes from different backgrounds and the things that i might think are very common may actually be new things for some people that is why i am enjoying living in the dorm right now and meeting all sorts of people i love to study and figure out why people are the way they are and what makes them act the way they act anyway , my rhetoric class this morning was not too bad once i'm up and out of bed , i can usually get to class and do everything that i need to do in my biology class , my teacher gave us a quiz we had not been told about it and it was over a chapter that most people had not read yet the quiz was worth 6 points and i got 3 three points was about the average of the class my professor is not american and he does not articulate his words this makes it very hard to understand and take notes luckily , i had a lab this afternoon and the ta was able to explain the lecture and help clarify so of the notes today , i am going to go to tops to get some of the pictures that i took this weekend i am so excited because i do not have many pictures on my wall right now my suitemate said that she would make me a bulletin board she is very artistic and creative , so i know it will be really cute tonight , i have a meeting for my sorority i chose to go tri delt i really like all the girls and we have been hanging out a lot everyone gets along pretty well , but there are always groups of people that tend to cling together i have tried to make friends with as many of them as i can right now everyone is worrying about where they should live next year it 's kind of frustrating because it is so soon how do we know who we will be friends with and hang out with in a year from now i guess you just pick and hope for the best my roommate and i decided to live together and both of us have been asked to live with other girls from our sororities so , we decided to get an apartment together and we have 4 other girls that we have met that are going to live with us i really hope we all get along and i'm sure everything will work out !
2003_234.txt 1 0 1 1 1 gosh , i'm so tired right now crazy and oh so overwhelmed with school i mean how much reading could i possibly get this semester i hate having vision problems it just feels like everything is this world is working against me i mean the blind people get all of their books on tape before me well reality check i can't read my books either i guess i could make a big stink about it because by law they have to arrange for me to get assistance for my disability but its too much hassle and i already feel really uncomfortable about my disability i mean i just hope that if i transfer schools that they will give me more individualized assistance something ut has no idea how to do why do i hate my roommate so much i think i need therapy for how much i hate her i actually get a pang in my stomach when i know she is at the apartment that is a major problem adn when i go into my apartment i close my bedroom door in order to say do not even try to talk to me and the really really sad thing is that i do not think she has a clue how much i hate her i have not had this much rage towards someone since 11th grade and those are the only two people in my whole entire life that i have ever hated staci and my spanish teacher its weird some people just rub me the wrong way and there is no forgiving them i get along with everyone i mean everyone so for me to have an enemy it is actually quite odd i wonder why dan and vab always have to act like they are cool and do not care about stuff it actually really bothers me i mean , for god 's sake , show some freaking emotion its so ridiculous ummm have i mentioned how tired i am my eyes are closing on me i really need to get more sleep in the future i wonder if i really should transfer schools i mean that would mean moving back into my parents house that would mean i ca not come home drunk i ca not bring guys back to just hang out gosh all the fun stuff i do here would have to end but then you just weigh that against my future i mean i think if i got more assistance for my disability , i would go farther in life which obviously is my ultimate goal no one even knows i ca not see well i hide it so well , i have known people for 3 years and they still do not know i mean they will make fun of my vision but they never put 2 and 2 together i wonder if i would if i was in there position oh my gosh i'm soooooooo tired now my eyes are burning is this a sick joke i still have like 8 minutes to go i do not know if i'm going to make it my money situation is horrible i seriously spend too much money on alcohol i mean i spend so much freaking time studying during the week , that i feel like i deserve to go out on the weekends ya know so i just spend my money on that so why is not it raining outside it was raining so magnificently last night i love it when it pours rain i reminds me of my dad we always would go outside on our patio when it would thunder and lightning and just watch it it was always so amusing to me and my sister and i would always have father daughter bonding time i miss my dad why does he have to live in egypt anyways what a joke my family does not deserve that one bit thank god he has a good and secure job though otherwise i would be at a community college instead of ut right now only 4 minutes to go ummm yep once again i am tired i got invited to a party tonight i kinda do not want to invite dan cause he always acts like he is too cool when in all reality i'm too cool for him so he feels like he has to act that way in order to compensate why is suneal gay he is such the perfect guy for me that royally sucks are not there any straight wonderful gentlemen still left in this world of ours i sure have not found them oh my ! 1 minute yippee honestly that was a very excruciatingly long 20 minutes i think you could have gotten the stream of consciousness point across by making it 10 minutes but whatever times up oh darn ! peace out
2003_235.txt 0 1 0 1 1 it is really really very very cold in my room i do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms it is also cold in the dining hall i am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on i am glad i brought two blankets sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep the chair is not so comfortable as a whole josh has one of those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever too bad he is a jerk eh owww i just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing i wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago we are going out tonight which is good because all i have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it is not all that fun i need to borrow duct tape so i can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly looking we were supposed to go to target sometime also , to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is cold some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room maybe i should figure out the whole bus system so i can take a bus down to them although walking is good exercise and i do need exercise you would think with an exercise room downstairs i would go down there and use it maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time i am done this i will go work out for awhile but then i will have to take another shower do not know if it is worth that because then i will also have to dry my hair and i hate hair dryers they are evil things whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person they never should have been invented same with makeup we should all just be completely natural if somebody really , truly , likes you , they will like you all the same with no makeup on at least that is my philosophy and i am sticking to it because i hate putting makeup on it 's a pain a waste of time , if you will the cd stopped i should put another one on now i'm going to have 'yo 's a ho' stuck in my head it 's not a bad song just not a song i would like to have stuck in my head i always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head it 's weird i do not know where they come from last night i had a dream that i was yelling at erin in someone 's driveway until she walked out on the street i am unsure of what we were yelling about but i do not think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other it 's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you i have an itch on my leg it 's itchy my hands are cold from typing , and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room too bad there is not a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have i wish i were staying in blanton i would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever i felt like it like people do there all the time the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying i guess i could go knock on some random people 's doors and watch tv with them or something meh i ca not believe lela 's dorm has a curfew that 's crazy at first i thought she was talking about visiting hours , because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday , but she was actually talking about a curfew they have to be in the building by eleven i guess they know who is in by who swipes their card that is like big brother or something 1984 i do not like it i mean , these people are all almost 18 years old and they are church of christ going people if they stay out past eleven or twelve , they are most likely not going to do something bad and if they do , i think that is their problem not the dorms' i definitely could not live like that i do not even like visiting hours my hands are still cold half the point of going to college is having more freedom if i only wanted to take classes i would stay at home and live with my parents but i wanted more freedom ( and also to meet new people and have fun ) so i guess that is what i have to do it 's a shame i am terrible at meeting new people and they are bad at meeting me it does not help that my psychology class has 550 people in it it 's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class and they all fit in one room our class could not fit in one room for the longest time , until they built the new auditorium my brother 's class has a thousand in it , but they are really bad so i wonder how many they will have when he graduates brrrr my hands are cold the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here i need to talk to my suitemates more they seem nice but we do not ever talk to them it 's really a shame i need to clean the water filter pitcher so i can drink some water water is good stuff josh says some girl he knows drinks 3 glasses of coffee a day i do not drink any caffeine i did one day and i was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff it was not enjoyable my mom drinks coffee everyday i do not understand why people think they need it is it psychological or do they really need it to wake up on tv people always say lets go get coffee or we need some coffee and it 's always after some traumatic event or really late at night i think that drinking coffee then would make things worse what you would need is some sleep , and caffeine would not help sleep it would keep you awake at least it keeps me awake i guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them i wonder why andy called this morning i called him back twice and he did not answer either time weird people are weird all of them especially james with his bald head it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of i am a d d does not really make all that much sense because the core is so disciplined i would think it would be good for a person who had a d d i wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word that would look really funny like 2 3 of a well i am going to end this the way i started it it is really really very very cold in here

2003_240.txt 0 0 1 0 0 ok so i am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes well , this will be good typing practice except in keyboarding class , we were told what to type so this might be a problem this seat is bothering me it 's hard to get comfortable in it its really low as well and these stupid wheels they do not let me stay in one place hmm its a good thing i do not have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk although i do not know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair because in my room , i have carpet this is a tiled floor , so that is why the chair is so rolly when i sit on my roommate 's chair , it does not move so much so that must be it it must be because of the carpet oh , there goes my stomach i'm hungry but i do not want to eat till moiz calls once moiz and omiar come over , i can order the pizza but the problem with that , is that i am hungry now i want to eat now maybe something small when i get home but knowing me , my small snack will turn into a meal oh well i can wait i guess i wonder if they think its cheap that i'm inviting them over on monday this way i order the cheap monday madness pizza but i guess its not really a big deal i was going to invite them over soon i want my computer up and running asap i ca not believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu that is so awesome but then again , that might lead to problems of me doing less studying , and more downloading songs online i hope bilal and them come tomorrow i mean , we do not want to be waiting for them every day , waiting for uncle 's call to say oh , well we still could not book the tickets , so they will be coming tomorrow hmm i smell smoke but that ca not be right who , no what idiot would be smoking in a building well , i guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do i mean , lots of people do smoke , but i just would not assume that they would be smoking inside a building ohh kay now my hands are getting tired i do not think i was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes was i oh well that 's what i'm doing haha i ca not believe i was so stupid today i have been going to urdu class at 12 for over a week what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one if i had gotten there right on time , i would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late especially in a class that was not mine ! it 's a good thing i went and talked to the professor she is awesome ! i really did not think that she would let me sign in i came way after the bell rang ! anyways , that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday but then again , i have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework i have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow when did all these quizzes come up it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class i guess summer went my pretty fast for me wow it really did pakistan was awesome i do not think i have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there , not as much as i had this time and saqib , rashid , and khurram they are as cool as they have always been i like the fact that we are all still cool well , it took a while for us all to open up , but at least we did and i'm upset with raza i did not realize till a little towards the end , that his walkman never left his ears i do not know , does he not understand or does he not care because if he does not care , he should not be coming that is really bad and think of what everyone else thought i'm sure they minded too ohh a minute and a half left weird it does not seem like i have been typing for twenty minutes straight i guess this was not so bad after all i wonder what happens after my time is up will i not be able to type anything else well , i will find out in 40 seconds now after this , i got to pick up my i'd from the business school , then then i dunno i could either go to the library and finish up my reading , which would be the smart thing to do , or i could go home and study but that will never work hmm , i think i just answered my own question
2003_243.txt 1 1 1 0 0 okay i am really clueless right now on what i am supposed to be doing i'm pretty sure we are just supposed to write whatever is on our mind , but i have never had an assignment like this one so that seems really peculiar to me my back kinda hurts , does that count plus i'm wearing christmas socks , they are white with red and green snowflakes , but i like them now i feel weird , like maybe i'm not doing the assignment right , i do not know what to put i'm the type of person that always likes to have clear directions on what to do someone tells me to do something , and i do it that way i know that what i'm doing is right but oh well i have missed two calculus classes in a row , and that is got me worried i'm really aiming for a 4 0 people would make ut as a school that is completely hard , and all u do is work and that 's partly true , i always find myself reading , and it takes me a full day to finish a math assignment the weird thing is that i would never read in high school , so i thought it would be a major drag surprisingly it 's not i do not think it 's that bad last night i was reading for economics , but i was too sleepy and nothing i was reading was sinking in i set my alarm clock for 7 40 , but it did not go off so i missed calculus that is got me worried but i'm pretty sure that i will do okay now i have 7 minutes and 50 seconds writing , still not too sure what i'm doing , still having my doubts i think of so many things when i'm by myself , i go into my own little world and just think about anything and everything but when i'm asked what i'm thinking , i go completely blank and people think that i'm just holding things from them , that i'm keeping to myself maybe that 's partly true , but i really do go blank a lot of times my memory is really weird i can remember the smallest most insignificant details about something , and then not remember something important that occurred okay i just noticed that when i started writing , i was sitting up straight now i am completely slouching , and now my back hurts i do not know why i said that my back was hurting earlier , it really was not perhaps it was just because i had nothing to say but now it really does hurt i have back problems , last time i got an x ray it showed that it was 16 or 19 degrees crooked i do not remember which one it was and that was a long time ago i really should go again which reminds me , i need to go to a dentist too i have not gone to a dentist in about 5 or 6 years my parents go , but my sister and i have not gone they told us to get the dental health plan here at ut do they even have that i'm pretty sure they do , i'm just procrastinating i'm not too consistent on my thoughts or actions i give in really easily to things i wish i would not oh well i'm sure i'm not the only one now 14 minutes and 50 seconds have gone by a few more to write whatever it is that i'm thinking and i went blank again well i started to notice my back again , so i decided to sit up straight i want to go do laps in the swimming pool i used to be in swimming when i was little , i was pretty good i remember that i had a swim meet on my birthday , and i was not too happy about that i hated competition i hated going to swimming classes , to brownies , jazz dance , and especially karate tennis too its weird how when ur little , you hate going to all of these things that ur parents make u go to , but when ur older , u whish u would have stuck with them i was also in gymnastics , but i think i kinda liked that i remember the first time i had a swimming lesson , i was afraid to get in a pool , so my mom pushed me in i have class in like 10 minutes , but its in this same building and hey , for this class as a matter of fact pretty damn convenient right well now i have taken care of this assignment , i still need to read like 2 chapters for this class and another one for eco but i do not even know what we are supposed to read people told me the first 2 chapters , so i guess that is it anyways i'm done
2003_245.txt 0 0 0 0 0 i am in my dorm room in jester west staring at the keyboard my friend 's dad just bought me a new dell computer because mine was so old that it would not recognize ethernet because the technology is too new i am listening to an allman brothers band cd that i downloaded and it 's pretty good i do not know if i'm doing this right but i guess i am because i'm just typing what i'm thinking i had to wake up at 8 this morning for a ta session for calculus which was of no help at all she gave us the easiest problems ever and the class ran late so i had to walk into my biology class after it had started it seems in math the teacher always explains things that are so easy and when u get to the homework u find that its nothing like class at all i am noticing crumbs on my keyboard from the new flavor blasted goldfish extra cheddar i sampled some in the campus store and they were so good that i bought them ok now it is getting hard to type bc i keep thinking too hard i think i am now downloading the movie super troopers the very first thing that i downloaded after getting my computer was the movie yellow submarine i love having kazaa because i never have to buy cds or dvds ever again i have an hour until my next class which just so happens to be psy after that i think i am going shopping because my dad 's wife just sent me 100 dollars for a graduation present my sister is iming me right now she had an away message about how mondays suck or something so i told her to think about pollyanna haha i thought it was funny my roommate went outside to study because our room is like 20 degrees below zero at all times i like my roommate but she is one of those overly caring people i feel so bad saying anything mean about her though because it seems like i inconvenience her more than she does me well maybe not i do not know i thought that the university would match roommates according to their time schedules and interests haha it was kind of funny because i was just assuming that my roommate was going to be a person who listened to the same kind of music that i do because that was one of the questions that you had to answer well she does not and she only has like 5 cds and they are probably the worst ever , well maybe not but avril levine is one of them which indicates a total lack of good taste in music for her part it always makes me wonder when people are really smart but they like dumb things like she has serendipity i am a big john cusak fan but that movie was awful everything they said sounded so practiced and forced it was disappointing , and i probably spelled that wrong i can never remember if there are 2 s 's of 2 ps and maybe there are 2 of both i do not know i guess ill look it up after i am finished with this which i almost am i have less than one minute left woo hoo no i'm just kidding , this was not too bad and i got to practice my typing i can type pretty fast but i look at the keyboard and i
2003_246.txt 1 0 1 0 1 this is a strange colored screen i'm glad the page has a timer at the top , i really did not want to keep track of time myself i have so much work to do today , i'm just glad that i have lots of time to do it i should probably make sure that i do not misspell words and all of that , it 's not like i will have time to check it over when i'm done i almost feel bad for whoever has to read this , i mean there 's probably going to be a large amount of frighteningly boring writings ( including mine ) trying to write this with the tv on probably is not a great idea either , so off it goes this weekend should be a good time , but i'm still not looking forward to it i still need to get a birthday present for a friend of mine as well i should look online to see if she has anything going on the day of the mars volta show and get her tickets , that would be very cool knowing my luck she probably wo not be able to go , but i should still try her parent like me enough to let her stay with me , but i do not know when she would go back home hopefully she wo not have a game that friday , or else none of this will work i still need to help jessica with her homework , and somehow find time to go to practice tonight this band really is not as much fun as i thought it would be in fact , the music is really boring me i should talk to them about possibly adding or taking away parts to make it better these guys listen to way too much indie rock , which means i probably wo not have a good chance of making the music any harder this is going to be a very long writing , so i apologize for whoever has to read this i hope studying for latin does not take too much time tonight , because i need to get to bed early it 's amazing that i can wake up at 11 15 to be in class by noon , yet i am still tired even if i got like 10 hours of sleep i do not know how people go to class at 8 i tried an 8 30 class this summer and i ended up not going to it more times than i went i always figured that going to class would be the easy part i was wrong i can still manage to fall asleep in any class so long as its during some sort of lecture maybe one of these days i should go to bed at like 8pm and just see when i wake up naturally chances are i still wo not get out of bed before noon the night is such a better time to do things its not incredibly hot , there 's not as many people out , and there are a lot more interesting things to do at night ( say on 6th street ) than there is during the day granted you ca not exactly go clothes shopping at 2 in the morning , but you do not get to see bands play during lunchtime either i ca not wait for next weekend going down to san antonio to see my friends play is going to be a great time hopefully i can get some more friends to go with who might like their music if not , oh well they are playing with another band that i really enjoy as well , which should make for a very enjoyable time i should spend more time in san antonio , there is a lot of stuff to do there 6 flags is nice if you have the money , i just do not have the money as of late i should really try to find a part time job up here so that i can have some resemblance of cash flow maybe get a decent job and save up enough money to go somewhere this summer i would really love to go on a cruise or something like that unfortunately , i will probably end up spending the money on bass gear and food i need food to live though , and bass gear is always good i still need to do the pretesting after this as well i do not have a printer either , that could be a pain hopefully i can just save the page for printing and simply print it out after i go buy a printer the time is almost up and it really did not feel like it took long at all maybe that is because i'm used to writing like 6 page papers , i like the simplicity of this i wonder how many grammar rules i broke during the course of this writing oh well

2003_248.txt 1 0 1 1 1 today all i think about is snow skiing , i cannot wait to be in the mountains , its so liberating and right now i feel so tied down and constricted , my room is annoying me at the moment because i do not like my desk space , it is uncomfortable so i find it hard to work in , which makes me not want to do anything at my desk right now i feel so lost in life , there are so many things that i want to do and i know i have all the time in the world , but i feel like everything is moving so fast , especially now that my best friend is back at school , i feel we just started summer together yesterday and now he and i both are gone and back our separate ways , which is for the best , but at times it is so hard because i feel like a whole sector of my life is missing and i spend most of my days thinking about it and how it really is not that long until we see each other again and i look forward to the coming years but i get scared because i wonder if my future involves him we have many of the same passions and we desire to do the same things , but i wonder if we will do them together or own way i constantly think about my future but not really the success aspect , but rather the things that i want to do the things that make me happy , which for awhile would not include a job i guess i do not really think about growing up that much but really like i said earlier that all i think about is going skiing this winter , i feel like the mountains are my home , like that is where i belong and i am itching to get back , because i have not been in so long when people ask where my favorite place to be is , it is definitely the mountains its like this little place god created where i can get away and forget about everything that drags me down , and just allow me to stand in awe and take in all that this earth has to offer , its like it releases me not only that i love skiing it is my favorite form of exercise , and its just all i can think about considering how hot it is here and i cannot wait to get away the heat and get where the air knocks you off you feet

2003_254.txt 1 1 0 1 0 okay so i'm sitting here in my dorm room and looking out the window and i see trees and squirrels and birds i really like my dorm because when i walk outside to go to class i always see so many squirrels and they come right up to you and they always are carrying nuts and okay maybe i should stop talking about the squirrels but they really are cute i'm trying to think what i have done today because i feel like i'm wasting the day away i woke up at about 12 30 and went up to my friends dorm room and got her and her roommate out of bed we all went to subway obviously because we were hungry and sat there for like 30 minutes i came back to my dorm and my roommate is very consistent about getting on my nerves her boyfriend broke up with her 2 days ago and she definitely is not being the sweetest person she is rather annoying and whenever my ex boyfriend calls me , she freaks out i think she is jealous but what is there to be jealous of it 's not like i have a wonderful boyfriend my ex boyfriend travis he goes to utsa because he did not get into ut he will be here in a year well he broke up with me before we went to college for unknown reasons and was a total jerk i feel like such a prissy girl talking about my boy problems hmmm well basically he ( travis ) came crawling back and is begging for me to get back together with him we were together for almost 2 years well i told him we might be able to get back together but really i have no intentions of getting back together with him until he gets to ut and by then hopefully i will have either found another guy or completely gotten over him i love him still and it frustrates me college frustrates me right now i always had a lot of work in high school so i am used to the work load but i am just boggled down with things to do like laundry and sorority crap that is pointless we had some pledge retreat to go to this weekend and i skipped out on it i feel guilty but then i do not i did not see the point in spending the night at the chi o house and sleeping on the floor in a room with 51 other girls when my mother pays a lot of money for me to have a comfortable bed at scottish rite i do not think the sorority girls will buy my reasoning what so ever oh well what can i do nothing i miss my friends hmmmmm i never thought i would miss my ex boyfriend this much but he was my best friend for a long time and it would be nice if he was here so i could escape from all the petty college stuff like frat parties where the boys are only looking for one thing or the binge drinking ( seems like everyone here is obsessed with getting wasted it 's like the girls in my dorm ( which is an all girls dorm ) have never tasted a sip of alcohol in their entire teenage lives and now that they have experienced frat parties they ca not get enough do not get me wrong i love partying and the occasional wild nights but then i also believe that frat parties get old on a different topic i have a bunch of homework to do at least i'm getting this done and i'm enjoying it at the moment it 's very relaxing typing whatever i want not having a strict curriculum to follow i wish i could meet some guys that are not just interested in sex that grosses me out look my thoughts are running rampant but then i also miss things with travis but then i do not miss travis because i'm in austin doing whatever i want in the heart of the city , but then i stayed home last night a saturday night and i was in bed i guess i'm some sort of loser i almost feel like if i do not party every single night i am like the biggest loser ut has ever seen i need to separate myself from all this greek b s hmmm you know what else i need to do laundry read pyschology calculus homework that 's another thing that worries me the difficulty of my calculus class i have already found a tutor and i'm having mass problems with the homework oh well i will get through it somehow right i have tutoring tonight at 6 is not this little story of my life so interesting i need like 4 boyfriends at one time like my friend kim or like 20 activities to do at one time like my friend geoff no i really do not need to deal with that stuff actually i have problems enough worrying about what i should eat in my dorm buffet style dining room or what colors go in what washer for laundry or how much time my calculus homework will take me ( probably 3 hours ) wonderful so much to look forward to so little time i need to relax i need a back massage i need my mom 's cooking and my own bathroom i wo not be getting those things for a long looong time i have no plans on going home if i go home my curfew will be midnight funny how the parties in austin do not actually start till midnight oh another thing i hope i make good grades to make my mom happy she seriously is worried about me and my grades she probably thinks i'm partying so much which is not the case at all i think i actually am in my dorm too much wait she is going to get mad because i went shopping and used her credit card oh lord i will be getting a call in a couple weeks lindsey what is this arden b store on my credit card bill and why did you spend amount of money there and why do u need those clothes anyways oh no well i have been doing this for 19 min and 11 seconds and it went by pretty fast and i'm sure whoever reads this will be like what is this girl talking about but that 's okay because i'm sure there 's a lot of those in the big pile of writing assignment 1 's well my 20 min are up and i am closing this lovely stream of consciousness with my favorite quote just to add a magic touch you will make all kinds of mistakes but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you will not hurt the world or even seriously distress her she was made to be wooed and won by youth winston churchill
2003_258.txt 1 0 0 1 0 i do not really know what i want to write about i am about to start watching football i used to like pro football a lot more , but now i really just do not care i would much rather watch college that pro i am downloading some music right now i am ready for this paper to be done so that i can go and watch some football i hope that this class is not too hard i do not want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major when i was walking to class today i was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier but it will be ok , i'm just going to have to study the other reason that i do not like that class is that i do not know anyone so everyday i come in a couple minutes before class starts and i sit down and the only talking that i do is small talk with someone that i do not know that gets old after awhile , saying the same thing over and over again it 's always what classes are you in and how 's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing it just gets really old 20 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock i am ready for the weekend to start football weekends are the best this weekends tailgate is going to be a blast there are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling this is getting old , because i'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and i am about to fight him he keeps on laughing at me and i do not like it here 's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder he is not as much of a prick as the other one i do not want to fight him right now he just walked out of the room my other suitemate has not walked in yet he probably wo not he is pretty weird he sits in his room and plays video games most of the day other than that he just spaces out and watched tv he does not party either i feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff i think he knows one person up here but they do not really go out and that is no fun because i know that he is not having a good time up here but maybe this is just the normal thing for him he does not seem like he was a real social person in high school i only have 4 minutes of typing left here so then i will be done and be happy i'm listening to some new austin music right now this paper is almost done , so i am happy my friend just told me that his dad drinks o would ouls , that would not be fun my dad drinks real beer now my paper is done
2003_260.txt 1 1 1 0 1 i hear nicole 's printer printing i'm so glad she is my roommate i really like the song that 's playing on the radio i wonder if my laundry is ready yet paul is a big poo face i wonder if i should tell hijm about my date with zach on friday it 's under the table i do not think that i'm very good at this stream of consciousness thing i have to look at the keys when i type on it 's kinda annoying i wonder if the professor takes off for stupid internet phrases like lol or kinda man i really ca not stand paul i hope that zac does not turn out to be someone who 's just looking to be laid this assignment seems like it will be really easy someone just popped up on i'm i wonder if it was dylan i'm supposed to go to a concert with him on friday but zac and i were supposed to go out then i wonder what it would be like to live in austin for all your life new braunfels really sucks at some points in time right no my stomach feels kinda weird probably fro the spaghetti i ate at dinner and nicole 's macaroni she htes macaroni cause she got a noodle caught in her throat one time which reminds me of the time i got a peppermint caught in my throat ooh walking on sunshine by reel big fish it reminds me of warped tour with dylan kelly and i do not remember who else went but it probably was not that important oh it was ronnie now it 's going to be me dylan paul patrick jon joe and james and nick all going to static x and staind in october , i'm really excited about it but kinda scared i'm walking on sunshine my feet hurt from the shoes i was wearing today i love them , they are converse sneakers so cute and they look like they would be comfortable but they are really not which is kinda disappointing rambling like this makes me feel like anne hathaway on princes diareis which makes me think of her in the other side of heaven which is one of my favorite movies nicole and i watched josie and the pussycats last week at some point in time i wonder what mark will think once i tell him that i have a date if i even bother to tell him i already told ward , i think that ward may like me but probably not and do not it feel good i dig this song , we sang it in choir in sixth grade which brings back memories of casey and how we were the best of friends up until a stupid boy came between us i can hear the air conditioner going and the clicking of nicole 's mouse she is doing a cog lab for some reason she is upset that she scored against the norm on it i think that she is really smart and am glad that she and i are roomies it was weird though cause i was in here while she and greg her boyfriend were cuddling she has a question for me but ca not remember it i suppose i will pay attention she did an experiment and has to print it out and it has to be the final name it seems like it should be daniell instead of nicole wow it 's only been seven minutes and i'm running out of things to think about well if it 's saved under that name um perhaps you should talk to greg about it i think she is oops i did not realize she was on the phone i miss dancing and am kinda nervous about trying out for the roustabouts i think they are called my hair is tickling my nose i wish that i would never had bangs to begin with it seems like such a hassle to take care of them and it 's taking so long to grow them out nicole is trying to get greg to help her with her computer stuff over the phone he will probably end up coming up here and then i will have to go down and hang out with ward and mark in my pjs to avoid feeling awkward if nicole and greg start getting touchy feely i think that he is going to come up i'm glad that they have worked everything out now but it kinda makes me depressed because i do not really have anybody and paul is being a big poo head which is his new name poo head paul i wonder if punctuation and capitalization and spelling count in this probably not because it 's not like humans think using punctuation or caps i like the punk version of this song punk rock princes by something corporate dylan went to see them with 311 last week i wish that i hyad gone now but i have not even started my biology questions yet and i'm afraid of failing the course and am considering dropping it my tailbone kinda hurts from sitting here so long i do not think that i want to be on aim when paul gets back i should leave a message up on friday saying that i have gone on a date it should pose for some interesting conversation with him later on that 's for sure geez 12 minutes that means that i have still got 8 to go my alarm should go off when it 's been that long my laundry is probably already done i'm glad nicole showed me how because i had neglected it for so long we talked to a cool guy in there but i forgot what his name was he was a business major though i wonder what the weather would be like tomorrow hah nicole said anal and she is talking about laura vasquez a girl from our old high school i think i saw ben campos in my psych class today but it 's been so long since i have seen him and think that i keep seeing people who are not really the people i'm thinking of so it might not have been him i really would not like to see any of them though i came up here to get away from them but oh well , c'est la vie and cool sheep tiffany laughed at that phrase earlier i just do not like beans enough to say cool beans sheep are so much better i feel like a child babbling on and on to an uncaring adult and my time is almost up so that 's a good thing i think i have already been through four sogs already nicole 's kinda computer illiterate though she did learn how to download stuff from her camera to computer which is more than i can probably figure out i'm thinking about my psych class now and the huge screens used to project the stuff i expected everything to be without overheads or any sort of indication on what we should write down it being all us and sucks for us if we do not know what to study for the test i really should do my biology but i'm not in the mood i keep saying that i will do it later but honestly it wo not get done i think that i say the word honestly too often and i make too many typos when i type i really like my laptop keyboard though the keys are nice and compact and make cool noises when you press them rather than nicole 's chunky computer keyboard but what would you give away to have somewhere to go to i do not think that i would give up everything for just one other person though the bible says so which reminds me that i should probably e mail my bible study instructor christie later on tonight just to let her know what is going on her kids go to school in austin jon and katie they are really cute christie and her husband got divorced a while ago and it seems like a horrible thing that they went through i do not really want to ask her about it though cause it 's not my business and it seems like a touchy subject which brings to mind richard who called paul a dick after i told him that paul had told me that he kissed jade i think i'm getting better at accepting the fact that they are together at least it 's easier to do up here than in nb it seems that the further away from my problems i am the easier they become to handle i wonder how many other people are doing their assignments today my alarm just went off and it scared the crap out of me i will have to go get my laundry after i'm done maybe i will try out my new iron and ironing boars are we supposed to

2003_267.txt 0 1 1 1 1 ok well i have been putting this off for a while , but now i'm sitting down to do it just to let you know i'm really bad with punctuation and spelling and capitalization when i'm typing on the computer its good in word because it corrects your spelling and capitals and grammar for you , friends is on the tv in the background right now , that show has been on for a long time i'm really kinda stressed right now , i feel like i'm really behind in my classes and reading and homework it would be good to have like a full free day or two i guess that is what the weekend is , but this weekend i'm going home , my parents are really excited that i'm going i have to get my acr fixed because i ran into a tire on the road the other day and it screwed up the bumper i never understood that , who is the guy driving around with no tire i really really do not understand that things are a little weird right now , my roomie 's going through some rough times and i'm trying to be there for her , i really hope i can be all shse needs and than my boyfriend is like 600 miles away up in arkansas and i miss him like crazy i wish he was here sometimes , but it seems like we will really enjoy the time we have together now that its limited he is a great guy and i miss him so much anyways i'm not really sure what to write about now , my classes are ok , but i feel bogged down with work right now , i do not want to feel like i'm complaining about it i also am a really bad typer i never took that class in grade school where they teach you the home row and stuff and so i have to look at my fingers a lot , really , i should not blame it on not having the class , i could have learned on my own , but i did not , oh well , i'm making it but i'm not correcting my spelling and typos very much right now , but i notice that as i type my typing is getting better and faster and i have to look less and less at the keys because i'm getting more and more used to it as i sit here college seems weird to me so many people , so many changes my roommate and one of my suitemates are both friends from high school which is awesome , they are great but its been hard for all of us to get out and meet people because ww hang out together a lot so that we do not have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations and deal with new people but i talked to some really nice kids today things are good , i do not know if i should go home or not this weekend but my parents really want to see me and its just a drive to houston which is not very bad so i'm going to go , i'm looking forward to seeing my brother too , he is a freshman this year soooooooooooooo anyways i do not know what to talk about seinfeld is on tv now , i really like that show , funny , lighthearted , and you never have to know anything from the previous episode to catch the new one , i really like that because then i do not have to be committed to watching every night all my books are on my bed right now and this writing assignment is not due for two days but i'm doing it now , even though i have assignments due in the morning , i think i'm just putting those off and instead i'm doing this because it seems a little more enjoyable than doing calculus problems or something like that , or reading , ugh i hate the reading i'm not a good reader i do not think , i'm horrible at reading comprehension , at least that is what the standardized tests say but anyways i'm a slow reader , i think , ok only 30 pages but then 30 pages take me like an hour and 15 minutes no small ordeal wow i ca not believe i have written this much i'm only 14 minutes , i have no idea what i'm going to write about for 6 more minutes blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah i wonder what happens if you push the finish button before the time is up , i do not want to try but i bet someone does someone who just wants to get out of whatever they can maybe someone will tell me sometime yay one of my suitemates just came home , she is on the phone , she is really cool she just asked what i was doing , i tried to tell her and write at the same time , i did not do very well , my fingers did not press the right keys , hard to do two things at once , i'm not one of those people who can like talk on the phone and clean or mess with the computer at the same time , i need to focus on talking on the phone or something else not both , that is probably because i do not want to let the other people think that i'm not paying attention to them , ah i just got distracted for like 10 seconds yipe so anyways , well my timing is going down i only have two more minutes left and now i feel like i need a break but i do not have time for breaks , i think i will make some coffee and stay up late and get stuff done yay only one more minute my room is messy right now too i do not really mind it if its my mess though , oh well , ill clean it up soon , i am soooooo excited that this is almost over ! it was a lot harder just to write than i thought wow
2003_269.txt 0 0 1 0 0 i am sitting in front of my computer in a small jester dormitory i look around and i notice that the room is a complete mess i take a deep breath and i can smell something funny that 's right , that 's how jester rooms always smell like i am feeling pretty full right now after a eating a delicious sandwich from the jester city limits the room is nice and cold , unlike the hot and humid weather outside my roommate is out of the room right now , so it 's a little quieter than usually i am playing some music on my computer right now besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer , i can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways my roommate walks in after eating at jester city limits i say hi to him and how his dinner was he notices something weird as i read out what i am typing he asks , what the crap are you doing i respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class i turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next i am sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room i uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb i hear someone using the blow dryer in the bathroom , which is right outside of my room i look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks that reminds me that i have lots of other homework to do when i finish with this assignment i have a strange anxious feeling because i am a little behind in all my classes , especially with reading the textbooks i think about how i have missed three morning classes already , a quiz in one of those classes , and i get an awful , guilt like feeling because i do not want to do badly in my classes maybe i should go to sleep earlier tonight , for that matter , every night i notice my computer 's processor making slight noises as i am typing i take off my glasses because i only need them to read i look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work i still have left to do i notice that i have been shaking my right leg maybe i have been doing this the whole time some sort of a nervous habit i guess i feel a little pain on the surface of my knee i reach down and touch the band aid covering a wound that i suffered from playing soccer at clarkfield last night and the twenty minutes is up a pop up says that i can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness does that mean that i should just finish with my train of thought , or should i keep writing more and more maybe that would help me get a better grade on this assignment ok , i am going to just stop and press the finish button
2003_273.txt 0 0 0 0 0 well , i'm thinking that 20 minutes seem like an eternity when you do not have a topic to write about i'm thinking about how awkward it is to be in the computer lab writing about absolutely nothing now , i'm thinking about what would the reader thing about my grammar in my defense i'm not a native english speaker now i'm focusing on the girl right next to me she lives in my dorm , and i will probably never speak to her or get to now her because she is quiet and not my taste physically i feel bored already and it 's only been 4 minutes i'm thinking what on earth will i write about for the next 15 minutes and a half now man , i'm a slow typist it took me like 30 seconds to finish the last two sentences now i'm thinking about what will i do tonight i wonder if i should go watch once upon a time in mexico i really want to see it tonight , but the people that i'm going with are not nice people in my opinion they will probably be loud and make stupid comments as the movie is playing god , i find people like that annoying , but i do not have a car and i really want to see that movie what the heck i will do it ! god , 12 more minutes ! pass is passing so slowly ! i feel bored , and i'm wondering about the purpose of this writing assignment is someone really going to go through this boring stuff i'm thinking i should spice it up , make it worth the torture the poor ta is going to go thru reading through all the writings i feel i'm not creative enough to come up with some weird thought that is interesting , yet not crazy enough i will be summoned by pennebaker for some counseling i feel extremely bored now it sees like nothing is going on in my head i feel nothing , besides bored , and great expectation for this to end now i feel aroused , a hot girl just entered the room i'm thinking she must be one of those weird girls cause she is dressed in short short pants and is wearing catholic school girl socks and shoes i'm thinking i do not care if she is crazy no more she is hot now i'm wondering if the reader is going to be some girl she is going to think i'm a pig hahahah the girl is gone i'm noticing how everyone that was pretending not notice her started acting differently and more relaxed as soon as she left i feel better now , cause i have only got 1 and half minutes to go i'm feeling nothing , thinking nothing i'm just focusing on the clock i think this has been officially the longest minute ever i'm do

2003_279.txt 0 1 0 1 0 okay so now i am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing i wonder why i have to type that out what am i thinking of course this is what i am going to write this music that i am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer i feel very stressed out writing to a real timer i do not know why i think i will take off my head phones i had planned to write about a lot but for some reason i ca not seem to do more than write what my head is thinking about for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did i guess i can start by describing my environment lets see the air smells like air the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window right now there is not any noises and i feel somewhat stressed and anxious the timer keeps going coldly , without a thought to whether or not i actually have a though or not and i think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would maybe my perception of time is defunct if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought form my mind would have just sighed i ca not believe i have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down , its like i have to help him but i fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me i just woke up and for some reason there 's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart as if i feared that i am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly i ca not believe i have already written for 5 minutes , time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what i am doing , like i cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which i was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here i am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and i wonder if i am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense i really hope it does because if it does not well i guess my mind is simply disorganized but is not that what a mind should be disorganized do not we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk its like the old saying , think before you speak and etc etc etc if this is how my mind really thinks , i really think i cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind that is an interesting though , do i actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything i have just written that is really weird , is this how our sense of hearing works i have my own voice in my head only it does not have the auditory quality of my own voice , but rather i can hear it , its a strange process i guess i really ca not multitask when i am writing a stream of consciousness i see three ims on the bottom of this screen , all blinking yet unanswered perhaps i am not truly tracking my own mind i must dwell further in i would like to reveal something about myself perhaps something i did not know existed i remember my childhood i do not know why but for some reason i start remembering it whenever i think too hard that or i am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way the phone is ringing , should i go pick it up maybe i will just let my parents handle it , but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing looks like i had to pick it up for a bit , i hope the professor does not penalize me for 20 seconds of non thought but i can make up for it because it was my friend who i needed to help out today , he sounded pretty appreciative though i dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here i am fixing mistakes in my typing maybe i should just leave my mistakes in so i can listen to myself more right well now i feel nostalgic or actually no i do not i just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear no with white clouds and its a clear day and i was a little boy there 's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if i were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time , its breathtaking another thought sigh i miss my childhood and here i am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety i would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized ( if that is a word ) which it is not a word but i guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about it , yeah i make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually i have written so much originally i had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but i guess that was yesterday night when i was heated up about it today i just feel complacent about writing about nothing i see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs , just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now i feel disappointed why am i disappointed i guess i just thought i could find something that could prove that i am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that i write even regular to all people i do not know but i like being special well no now i feel embarrassed for writing that out and there 's only 3 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future , i ca not really plan ahead , i ca not think about my future , my ambitions seem to fade away i guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and i do not know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps i forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness , why am i so eager to put interest in this bit , i do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what i just said god now i am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if i tried to organize it i would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that i think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes i end up saying nothing because i dunno i know i obviously have a stream now but i guess since none of it makes much sense i ca not really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps i am just afraid that if i do people will laugh at me for being an idiot 8 more seconds 5 4 3 2 1 bye
2003_282.txt 0 0 1 1 0 rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now , i am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room you see , my roommate carly is sleeping she was fortunate to have no classes on friday i on the other hand , have chemistry on friday mornings at 10 you understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away , often until long after i return as is the case today , which is why i am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep it 's not that i need to sleep right now , it 's the idea behind it she sleeping while i am up and writing this paper this paper by the way is the first of two papers i have been blessed to right today this writing assignment is fun it 's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds one word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time , very different direction back to the second paper i will be writing today my ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday we meet twice a week , one on tuesdays and once on thursdays it is quite a walk to the nursing building it is located at the far end of campus , so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus but , i enjoy the class so the walk is manageable ahh , all these pop ups keep coming while i am writing this i really do not like the idea of pop ups back to my paper we discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class , all in preparation for the nursing field it 's hard to think of everything that we will one day face that is , if we actually get accepted into the nursing program it 's pretty tough i believe they do not accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program i hope i get accepted it seems to be the direction that god is pointing my towards i do not now though i think i need to have a couple more talks with him to see where he wants me and where i might serve him best well , i'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity so without further adew ( i do not really know how to spell that word , but go with me on it ) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology i sure hope i accomplished the task at hand it seemed easy enough but i guess we will see my phone is ringing i bet it is sterling
2003_283.txt 1 0 1 1 1 so i'm sitting here i do not know what to talk about except for the fact that the latest mars volta cd is amazing i especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music its panned all different kinds of ways to where if you are listening to it in a portable cd player or anything that has a distinct sound system you can notice all these minute details that they have injected in there any other way would require you to have incredibly sharp hearing sense i ca not believe i have a kitten now my mom told me to take care of it and get a job to support it i just laughed at that is it getting hot in here i swear one second i'm cold and the next i'm burning up and for some reason i'm having a hard time typing right now i think its because of the temperature that and lack of knowledge of what to say my cat is crawling up my leg and meowing right now i wonder what it is that she wants i wonder why the mars volta decided to say now i'm lost as the most definitive part of the chorus its pretty great anyways aww the cat wants to snuggle in my lap too cute i'm going to have to do so much reading tonight sheish so many classes and concepts to keep up with something smells like kitty litter uggg kitten she needs to stop biting me ahh she is going to tear my sweater that is my favorite sweater ! i have been everywhere and through everything in this black sweater i started out with it during my emo days of high school and then grew up wearing it good times and bad , i have worn this sweater man i ca not wait until i have my interview with saul williams its going to be so rad i ca not wait to do research on him so that i can know about every little detail to talk about hold on i need to take the sweater off great right when i decide to do that the air conditioning decides to come on just my luck , it always works out this way i wonder if i could ever get my poetry published it would be amazing to claim that i wrote a book or compiled just a whole bunch of all the poetry i have written sometimes i get paranoid that someone 's going to copy and steal it since i have it online not a good idea rola boy i really like this song i wish i could write songs this amazing i just wish my band did not decide to split they did it and did not tell me lead singer slash guitar player is the last to find out really genuine folks that is how life decides to roll the dice though man , that party after the mars volta showithsaul williams interview is going to be killer that is , if anyone decides to drive 3 hours and spend the weekend here hopefully they will that would be crazy i need a band again we need to get our dang cd mastered already so that i can play it on the radio i need to remember to get one of joey 's cds when i'm back in irving so that i can get them to play that on the radio man , i really hope he gets signed soon he is so talented and puts so much effort into everything he does it just feels like he gets nothing out of everything all the sacrifices he makes and all the time he spends , and he just ends up getting screwed over by life in the end i wish i could make everything better i wish i were a magic fairy who could wave a magic wand and make all of his dreams come true so that he would not have to worry about anything ever again i wish i could do that for anyone i could pick who 's deserving or not that would not be fair though since i would not be deserving of making such decisions myself dang i'm so philosophical good thing that is my major uh oh i told a psychology write up that i'm a philosophy major i'm assured to fail now eh i'm so tired i wish i could get more sleep it was pretty nice to talk about depression today hah i used to be depressed severely i'm so glad that all of that is in the past its nice to look back and learn about yourself i'm such a changed person and i keep changing and i keep analyzing myself and noticing different things about myself from day to day that surprise me and do not surprise me i wish more people at school knew me i have always been the person to walk the halls and have everyone know my name but me not know anyone else 's name that is my deal people would know me it sucks that this college ca not be like that what in like fifty five thousand people you are lucky if you find your own hand in that many people the buses are so annoying everytime i walk up to the dang bus stop and stand in front of the doors it just leaves without me like it knows when i'm about to come so that it can leave that is how the buses here in austin know when its time to leave the stop they just see me coming and its the all time cue that is what they teach the new bus drivers in training if they ask so when do we leave they say when rola comes my head itches press the finish button when you are done twenty dang minutes is a long ace time to keep writing nothingness its all good in the hood , i have like less than 6 minutes to go w00t ! you know it seriously sucks that people suck i wish people could be a whole lot nicer than they are but what is nice anyways gosh we can go all philosophy on that as it is spend like an hour and a year on that subject alone screw it i'm not in the mood to analyze anything i'm just so tired and that kitten wo not quit messing with the blinds if only i could stop typing this , get up , and stop that she is making the blind strings look like snakes from where i'm sitting and now the string is caught in her paw just great its like i'm babysitting no , it feels like i'm a mom now just more and more responsibility for me but she is so cute that its worth it man i wish i could play an amazing guitar riff like the one i'm hearing right now i miss playing music a lot every week i miss being on stage gosh i wish i had that feeling right now ultimate bliss no ! instead i'm sitting here typing this stupid thing so that i can get credit in psychology i better make a freaking a in this class or i will be so pissed it will be the end of the world and destiny at the same time if anyone read what i'm typing right now i'm sure they would pee in their pants from how afraid they would be that a person like me exists they are probably getting a lot weirder responses than this though right right less than one minute and i'm a free bird ! and that is not a pun ! whoever yells to play that at shows dude you are so behind on the times ! that is like the oldest thing to say ever you are just joining the masses when you submit to saying that at every show you go to tradition or not
2003_284.txt 1 0 1 1 0 i'm not quite sure what to write about , and i highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper ! it makes me nervous to turn in a paper that i wo not have time to proofread or check over one of my english teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper ! luckily my teachers are not like that and this is the first paper i have had to write so far which is a good thing , i'm definitely not complaining it is also the first actual homework assignment i have had , the rest is just reading and reading and more reading ! luckily most of it is interesting i know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework , but i do not think so it is not harder because there is more time to accomplish things in the besides , teachers are not so anal here maybe it 's just ut , but i love it ! i love the liberal attitude ! anyway , my roommate is due back at any second everytime i hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way , i think it is her it 's a bit distracting , although i guess in a way i already am distracted i just do not know what to write about ! i really hope this paper is not graded on content ! but rachel , my roommate , is really nice she thinks she is a witch , which i thought was incredibly weird , but whatever i have not seen anything weird since i have been here unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is she did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met ! is not that weird i ca not imagine that relationship going anywhere but it makes me feel glad that i have michael he is been my boyfriend for two years , and now that we are in different cities , it 's hard ! i think he is taking it harder than i am , but i do not know how to help him ! i guess that if the situation was reversed , i would be freaking out too it 's just that i have so many things to do here , that i ca not talk to him every single time he wants to maybe things will improve with time i finally found the lyrics to enya 's song called only time it really has a great message , although almost all of her songs do as the title implies , she talks about how only time knows everything time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away knowing that is great , it 's just hard kind of like the saying easier said than done it 's hard waiting for things ! not material things necessarily , but for success and happiness and similar things i guess that 's what everyone wants happiness i'm scared that i wo not find it in my future work even though i love helping people and i know social work is a great thing , social workers make less than 30 , 000 a year ! it makes me wonder if i have some greater purpose in life so many things interest me that i feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with a friend of mine has the same problem and she said i feel like i have 10 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing and i feel the same way ! ideally i just want to make a difference and help people i'm sure that somewhere in the next four years i will figure out what i want to do it makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it , or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it who knows ! i have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study , but for some reason i just ca not concentrate maybe it 's because i took a nap and now all i want to do is go back to sleep ! for the first few weeks i was sleeping wonderfully , but i have not been able to for the past few days maybe pennebaker 's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me ! i doubt it though but it is great being in psychology although the book can be a bit boring sometimes , some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and i can relate to most of them ! michael laughs at me all the time because i am constantly trying to justify things in life by what i learn in psychology he has a terrible memory , so when i learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was , i immediately thought of him and of course he laughed at me and thought i was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he could not remember things well oh well i guess ! at least he loves me ! well , i have one more minute and i do not know what i'm supposed to close this off with , but i guess that means i'm supposed to keep rambling on i would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for , if any i would love to see what people wrote about probably friends and school , which seems to be what mine is dominated by , but maybe not !
2003_285.txt 0 1 1 1 1 well , i guess this is the first time that i have ever done anything like this i mean , the first time that i have talked about anything to anyone what i'm really thinking about right now is index cards i need to make flash cards for my introduction to medical and scientific terminology class , and i do not have any index cards i feel like i need to complete that task now why is it that i must always do everything in one day i just ca not ever seem to take my time and relax i guess if i had any form of ocd , that would be it i'm a perfectionist who needs to clear her schedule now , if i wait until this stream of consciousness writing is over , it will be like almost eleven thirty at night before i'm done should i really go out and get my index cards then i need like a pack of 200 of them , but i really need more for the future i guess i could wait to get more index cards when i get home to houston this weekend , then i would know exactly where to buy them , or i could even get my mom to get them for me in houston , that would be very convenient for me i miss my mom most she does everything for me its not that i miss her just because she did everything for me its just that she is this really great person she is so genuine i know she loves me truly because she goes out of her way to make me happy why ca not i meet more people like that in my life i hope i marry someone who can take care of me as well as my mom and dad can man , i miss my dog , too i guess i am a little obsessed with my dog , but i ca not help it she is so cute and she is been there ever since i was like 12 we are inseparable , and i wonder and worry about how she is doing without me dogs are great are not they they never get angry at you or make you upset they always are loyal , and give love one hundred percent i wish that people could be as nice as dogs are i wish my boyfriend would be happier he is the main reason why i worry so much of the time i really never thought it was really possible to cry so much that your eyes get swollen , until i met him i worry a lot about him , not about our relationship , but about him i wish he would be happier , treat himself better , love himself more , and feed himself the man 's the pickiest man i have ever met ! i have never made one thing that he thought was yummy i have never taken him to a restaurant that he thought was good everything is always decent decent i know he does not mean to be condescending in any way , but it really makes it seem that he is being super condescending i know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life food being one that should be simple to enjoy , but with his ideal of fine food , i do not know if he will ever feel that that 's one thing about psychology my boyfriend always says what he wants , but he never feels it when i try to give it to him i believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head , his innate response to anything i do is a negative one , therefore his response is negative his mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really does not like it it 's all in the mind if he told himself to like it , he would but the fact of the matter is that he does not all right , i'm going to shut up about him all ready i think that this writing assignment is pretty cool it 's like writing in an electronic diary , like on the show sex and the city , except that these thoughts are really not very private because i guess professor pennebaker or one of the ta 's is going to read it , but i'm really okay with one of them reading it it 's not like i have anything really vulgar or nasty to say i'm so full i do not think i should have eaten all that kraft macaronni and cheese , but hey , on the bright side , its a great source of calcium , which is something that growing women need , so i guess its kind of a good thing hahaha i ca not believe that i just tried to justify overeating , at least i do not have to worry about getting fat over it nobody in my family is fat or even chubby i do not think i have gained any weight here because i do so much walking , so who cares if i ate extra macaroni i used skim milk instead of whole milk , and i added salt to it instead of butter , thus i feel no guilt dude , i could really go for a coke right now coca cola is so good its so expensive though , and its so bad for your teeth and kidneys what makes it taste so good i think its that bubbly feeling you get in the back of your throat when you drink it not like that nasty gross diet cola diet cola is disgusting i do not understand why people drink diet when there 's real cola i'm sleepy i do not sleep much here in austin , because all i do is go to school , and then i come home , eat , and then do homework for the whole rest of the time it 's a bitch i need my sleep man i do not get more than 5 hours of sleep at most i had four freaking classes today ! can you believe that from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon , i had class and get this , what really made today bad was that while i was waiting for the bus , a huge , green , black striped , spider was crawling up my shirt and was like two inches away from my face ! i thought i was going to die ! i hate spiders ! if i had any kind of phobia , its spiders i do not like any bugs , but spiders are the worst they are so ugly and creepy and scary i thought i was really going to cry it made me so anxious and nervous i went home and showered my writing assignment is almost over now i feel a little bit of relief and a little bit sad at the same time , how pathetic hahaha i'm kinda sad because i like writing all my thoughts down , but i'm relieved because i have a lot of other stuff to do still

2003_287.txt 0 1 1 1 1 well i am sitting at my desk it 's kinda dark in here so i just turned on the lamp i have a lot of homework to finish , most of it for the psych class my homework has not been too bad so far just a lot of reading i am ready to go home and see my cat , i really miss him more than other things that i should probably miss more my mom would get mad if she heard me say that , but sadly it is true well my mind is a blank , i ca not really think of anything to say i know we are supposed to just type whatever comes to mind , but my mind goes completely blank whenever i try to write anything , no matter what it is i guess that is why i never could keep a journal or anything like that i would start out the first day writing some , then it just tapered off until i stopped writing completely i have several journals with only the first couple of pages written on wow 20 minutes is a long time , its only been 5 since i started i'm trying to keep writing for the entire duration , but it is weird how when you are supposed to write freely your mind wo not cooperate i guess that is what you are trying to figure out it is ironic how the mind works , that is why i have always wanted to take a psychology class , so i could better understand its inner workings i am frustrated that i really cannot think of a single thing however i miss my best friend , faith she is at oachita ( spelling ) in arkadelphia it is about 8 hours from here i am thinking about going and visiting her over spring break , but that is a little hard without a car i will probably have to fly home first and get my car from there surprisingly my parents are not going to sell it ( like they originally planned ) and are keeping it at home ( where it is currently getting no use ) i guess it was their last attempt to get me to come home some of the time i am only going home once before the holidays that 's only for my high school 's homecoming which i am kind of excited about i know a few of my good friends that are also coming home for the game , so i will get to see them that is the only weird thing about college you realize how much your friends meant to you it is odd not seeing them during class like you are used to but , luckily i have met a few great people , and we have become good friends i knew 8 people coming down here and only three of them i was actually good friends with the other five were more acquaintances i already semi knew my roommate , she went to school in the same district , and we met through our parents we have since become better friends i am sure whoever ends up reading this really wants to know all these things , but i figured i might as well write something well let 's see i went on a mission trip to mexico this summer i only thought of this because there is a picture of me and some of the kids we worked with on my desk it was truly an awesome experience i am a changed person because of that two week experience well i guess i wo not get into any other subject my time is ticking away , funny how it goes by faster when you type very ironic and that is about all , thank you !
2003_288.txt 0 1 0 0 1 hey ! i'm typing the first writing assignment for my psychology class that 's psy301 my professor is pennebaker i'm not sure how that 's supposed to be pronounced is it like pen baker or pen ne baker i'm thinking that it 's the second way hey it 's been two minutes only 18 minutes left now what should i type about right now i wonder if grammar , punctuation , and spelling matter in this assignment i doubt that it does i sure hope it does not i do not feel like capitalizing all my i s right now stream of consciousness what to type i do not know i should be able to type faster my leg is asleep is this going to submit automatically when twenty minutes are over i think i'm supposed to do it manually i wonder if i'm supposed to leave in errors on this assignment or am i allowed to use the backspace key it 's a pretty useful key the delete key does the same thing as the backspace key except it goes the other way my fingers are getting kind of tired is kind of correct grammar what should i type about now well , i'm using a computer in the computer lab in the west building right now to type up this writing assignment because the internet is not working on my computer my computer has only been connected to the internet like 3 times since i moved in here stupid airwave or maybe it 's my computer configuration that 's causing conflicts anyway , why do bad things always seem to happen to me these kinds of problems always seem to happen to me i'm like the only one here whose internet connection is not working hmm i hope we were not supposed to divide this assignment into paragraphs or organize it or something i feel like playing the guitar now i want to improve i do not think adri is in his room right now so he ca not help me now i do not think keerthan is in his room either what 's up with the weather these past two days my fingers and wrists are feeling a little tense now it 's been raining like on and off frequently around here hey it 's been 12 minutes now 10 minutes have passed since i last mention the time limit i think and now there are about 8 minutes left man , this is taking longer than i thought it would or it feels longer hey look at that finish button i want to click on it but it probably would not be a good idea click click clickety click dot dot dot i'm bored and tired crap , i got to do that experiment thing for this class too i wonder if he minds if i use slang in this assignment is got to counted as slang i'm kind of hungry not hungary that 's a country well i'm not really very hungry i just had lunch a couple hours ago it was not that good the tomato sauce for the pasta is too chunky and the liquid part is too thin yeah , not good stuff hey i got a three day weekend i like fridays , but i do not like wednesdays because i have four and a half hours of class then and i have zero hours of class on fridays ! weeeee doing homework on my free day hey less than a minute to go i wonder if the pennebaker gets tired of reading all of these assignments or if he even reads them can i get brownie points from this pennebaker is cool ! hey a pop up just told me that my twenty minutes are up , so i'm going to click that finish button now
2003_291.txt 0 1 1 0 0 i do not know if i'm still mad at my friend i hope she never does it again but somehow i think it will take longer for her to change should i leave her alone or still hang out with her i'm getting tired of taking care of everyone i do not know whether i want to go clubbing or go home this weekend i sort of want to go home and get more food because i'm getting tired of the american food here i do not hate olivia and i think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her i think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her i'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool i had a writing assignment like this in high school my psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she i do not know but is very strange i miss my high school life but i still prefer my college life in high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here , its different because there is no one to control me i sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home i never got to stay out late but now , i could do whatever i want i'm just afraid that i might mess up my schoolwork here at college i do not want to mess up because i want a bright future but then i also want to experience and have fun my college years so i have to learn how to set priorities to my life i miss my high school life and i know that i could never go back to it but i feel like i have truly lived my senior year of high school high school was fun because i made friends i know i would keep for a lifetime they are the ones i would call up if i'm upset or the ones i do not mind crying to but in college , i feel like , no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them my classmates here , we are all in competition and the only ones i could turn to for now are the friends i had in high school i just feel more comfortable being around them because i know that they have seen me through a lot of situations i wish i could make more friends here at ut because its such a big campus and i want to be well connected so i have started going to cbs and that 's helping a lot i think not only because i meet people there but also it calms me down because thurs night i went clubbing and after that i still felt wild but now i'm ready to settle down and work hard in college i do not want any regrets i wish i could also find a boyfriend here at ut so i have someone i could rely or depend on because i'm tired of being depended on all the time the ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me i would totally go for him i wish it was summer , i like this ut campus because it just feels like home it fits , because at home i'm always counting the days until i left home but now that i'm at ut i'm enjoying my days here i do not usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes i feel like its a waste of time i rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well does someone actually read this because this would be a lot of reading to do not only to read my writing but also to read everyone 's elses writing what is the purpose of this writing i'm almost done , five more minutes of just rambling this is like xanga everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts do they feel any different after they finish writing well xanga 's are interesting to read when i'm bored but i do not think i would ever have one just because i do not want to waste my time on that and that i do not want to post up my personal life i'm running out of stuff to say , i have never consider myself to be a very talkative person even to other people i wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because i'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something even if it was for schoolwork , i'm really anal about people touching my computer should i go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because i want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it is that selfish of me well i'm again running out of stuff to say and i have approx one more minute my goals for college is to succeed i do not want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall yay almost time 30 more sec blah blah 20 more sec i feel like an idiot just rambling here
2003_292.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i have no clue how to start this i have not bought my psychology book yet is that bad i wish i could do that dj thing at the beginning of class the guy last time played horrible music i made a friend in that class named kelly she seems cool i hope we get to hang out this feels like a diary entry is that what it 's supposed to be like today natalie and i went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people one girl we met reminded my of my ex boyfriends new girlfriend it really got on my nerves not because i'm jealous , just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation rob is really annoying me i would like to just stop talking to him altogether but hang out with him at the same time and eric i do not know what to do with eric i do not know if i love him or not i do not know if i will ever really be in love he says the sweetest things to me , so it 's easy for me to say sweet things back to him but i do not know if i really feel it or not i think i'm really heartless and i have not been in english for a long time ! i'm forgetting whether to capitalize the i in some words odd my arm hurts am i going to have to keep this up for 20 minutes i wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings mine is all boring teenage bullshit let 's try and write something deep it 's quiet in the dorm hall , save the occasional dorm slam all the girls are in their rooms , wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets the faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded , all in a couple of days soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous , and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future aaaand i'm spent that was so lame bullshit , as my english teacher would say he is really cool he made us write about a chair the other day , which was very interesting and he taught at pomona , which is my harvard i would love to go to school in california hopefully next year i can go to sfsu and be near eric and see if this thing will really work out are boys the only thing on my mind am i really that shallow at this moment , i'm afraid so i blanked i have to start a new stream i'm losing a lot of weight , i think my wrists are smaller than they used to be i do not know why that waifish look appeals to me i want to be super skinny and if not eating is how i have to get there , i just might do it i do not think i'm fat right now there are just parts of me that could be smaller and i'm too lazy to work out , so not eating will solve all of these problem areas i will be the anorexic that always eats milky way because those are so good and i could never give them up when do i become an adult i have no clue where that came from but really when it 's really quiet in here i can hear natalie typing on occasion she is a good student always on top of things our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in the other day it smelled like clam chowder not pleasant i miss my family i never thought i would i do not miss them so much that i would cry or be terribly homesick i mainly miss the meals and the fact that if i was sick they would go and buy me what i needed i took birth control for the first time on friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me it made me appreciate my mom so much more , which i rarely do yes , i am a spoiled brat i did not get as much stuff as other brats did , but i am one nonetheless and i have no concept of money because i am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in october to go see eric again and my mom will be furious at me if she finds out i'm not going to tell her this time i will give natalie all the information and pray my parents do not come down for a surprise visit i like our dorm room it has a lot of character i love our posters natalie and i have the same tastes in a lot of things of course , i would much rather have my best friend monica as a roommate i miss her so much and with her , i do miss her to tears she is the only one i could be myself around i love her so much and feel horrible about what i did to her last year i blew her off i was not a good friend and i will never forgive myself for it the girls across the hall from us just got home i do not like them that much jenny is nice she listens to morrissey and , however stereotypical that is , we think she is gay because of that most morrissey girls are lesbians and paige , the other girl , is really stuck up and she listens to lots of local bands from dallas that i despise so yes it takes a lot for me to warm up to people i'm very selective with friends which i should not be because i'm not the coolest person to hang out with and boy do i have low self esteem i constantly put myself down eric gets annoyed with it and i type really hard , too i think natalie is annoyed with this sound right now oh well seriously , is someone going to read this is there a right or wrong way to do it i hope not i'm sure i'm doing it the wrong way rob just told me that he is joining the army i do not want him to and i told him why and he told me not to be punk rock because i'm an indie princess that 's so lame just because i listen to that kind of music does not mean i ca not have political views and this was a good exercise very therapeutic thank you , professor !
2003_293.txt 0 1 0 1 0 well i'm supposed to write and i do not really know what to say i'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch tv i was not doing anything productive so i thought i would get this writing assignment out of the way do typos matter because i keep erasing , but i do not think it really matters ok i left one in so it 's really hot in here and my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type but oh well i'm waiting for the cartoon home movies , to come on i do not usually watch cartoons , but i saw this one once and it 's really funny and i liked it a lot wow , only 3 minutes have gone by i think i'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes i'm so sick of studying my roommate is talking about a little girl in a missy elliot video what song is this i have no idea i'm hungry , but i ca not eat and type at the same time my side itches hold on a second aw there we go much better so i do not understand why i have so much work to do in my english class it 's ridiculous ! it 's making me so frustrated my other classes give decent amounts of work to do , but that class is crazy ! i have to read 22 chapters in jane eyre by tuesday oh i like this song probably should not listen to it too loud because i'm trying to type , but it 's ok i seem to be doing ok with it on so far i'm really tired and i wish i could just go to sleep but i need to study some more before i do i have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks wow , i complain a lot i do not mean to , but i do ok running out of things to say talk about smells ca not smell much it 's pretty plain smelling in here if that makes sense damn ! only 8 minutes have passed ! twenty minutes feels like forever we did a stream of consciousness paper in creative writing in high school and i remember how much my hand hurt while i was doing it i need a massage my neck and back are really sore maybe from sleeping on a too small and uncomfortable couch last night and from driving from college station ( no i was not at a m ) to san antonio and then to austin today that could do it to you ! well i want a pretzel they are sitting right next to me but i ca not get them when is this thing going to over with i wonder what you learn from this how weird and random people are i think i'm a pretty random person i used to say that word a lot in middle school i hated middle school so much i do not know why it was just horrible for the most part and high school was not much better i like college a lot more than both already well my show should be coming on soon i ca not wait to watch it i hope it 's a funny episode ! i always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that 's not funny and think i'm stupid not that i care , but i want people to know that it 's a really funny show i need to be studying for english no , not english , music english just popped into my head hmm ok only 6 more minutes i think i can handle this wow , it got quiet in here and really really hot too ! at first our a c was broken and our room was 60 degrees , and we complained that it was too cold and now they fixed it and it 's soooooo hot in here katie just discovered longhorn delivery i love that thing ! i used to use it all the time when i used to come visit friends in austin we were all pretty lazy i'm becoming less lazy here i think i have to walk everywhere and ca not really rely on other people to do things for me like at home i want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents i'm not homesick , but it will be cool to see how things have changed since i left my parents have been re doing the house , probably out of boredom i think it 's cute that they are doing little projects together now i hope they have fun living together alone again , like before they had me and brother i have been warned it 's almost 11 30 and home movies will be on shortly ! i'm excited i think it 's sad to get so excited about a cartoon , but you have to get excited about something ! well my time is almost up and i'm glad oops , i hit the caps lock for a little bit ok 10 seconds and i'm done !
2003_296.txt 1 0 1 0 0 there are many things going through my mind right now however , i just wish i would have girlfriend i keep thinking i want one , but i'm not really sure if it would be really good for me looking around right now , i see my stuffed animal duck , my computer with its blue neon lights , my 8 2 speaker system , and my printer i really love my sound system the two sony speakers provide a great midrange , the 7 small logitech speakers give good highs , and my subwoofers provide all the bass i need my headphones are really nice too i can t believe i got them on sale for 30 what a deal i played warcraft 3 tonight for seven hours i look back and do not believe that i actually played that long , but i did after playing my first three hours , i decided to take a break but that game is too addicting i just finished and now its 2 36 am and i have nothing to do so i figure i might as well write my psychology stream of consciousness paper my roommate is fast asleep he really needs his sleep he gets a good 8 hours a night while i only get my 5 or 6 however , i take a bunch of naps to make up for it he is a really great roommate i intend on rooming all four years with him he respects my space yet jokes around with me when its time to have fun he keeps our room tidy and clean so we wo not be living in a pig pen my cell phone is really nice i ca not believe i got it for free cingular sucks though sometimes i never get reception in my dorm room or in any of the buildings so if people call , i never get any notice , which can be frustrating i really miss my best friend kenny he is in st louis right now he just got grounded for staying out all weekend without coming home now i ca not talk to him or even get in contact with him i really miss him i wish that he and his aunt would not have been fighting if that were the case , he would still be in houston right now this paper is really interesting because its putting down everything i'm thinking i'm thinking whatever and its just coming out my mind is not really in a solid thinking mood probably because it is 2 41 am my mind feels jumpy right now i am still looking at my computer monitor and the duck that sits on top i'm really glad we lofted our beds in our dorm it gives us so much more space under the bed is our desk which has my computer on the adjacent wall , our tv sits between the two dressers i really miss home its nathans birthday today , and i wo not be home to wish him a happy birthday that just reminds me that i have to call him tomorrow or else he may get upset i m getting my postit notes out right now but i ca not find a pen where is it oh there it is eric is fast asleep how can he sleep so early well i guess its not that early looking at my walls , i have 3 dave matthews posters , an art poster and a better luck tomorrow movie poster on one wall are all my pictures from my senior year i really miss my old friends that are not going to ut austin is fun though i have made so many new friends through basketball , classes , and just walking around i find it really hard to remember names though i feel bad sometimes because i have to ask the person 2 or 3 times what their names are i miss anh back at rice i like her a lot she is just one of those people that are easy going and relaxed about everything i wonder how this year i have gotten so lazy i'm too lazy to study for my classes and i can barely make myself do the homework assignments i use to be so studious i guess that was before i had a good computer and a basketball gym plus i had my parents around back in houston bugging me to do things i'm really glad i'm not working though i can now concentrate purely on school however , i need to start getting back into the swing of things so i wo not fail my first semester my classes are not difficult , so i better get a 4 0 ok i have two minutes left my mind is starting to shut down i am getting tired i'm not sure if i can stand the 1 5 minutes left this is pretty hard towards the end when you are tired and ca not think of anything my mind feels like jello looking out my window , i see the tower i'm so lucky to get san jacinto 5th floor my room view is absolutely amazing at night i think it is weird how my mind works
2003_297.txt 0 1 0 0 1 music is great someday by nickelback has got to be one of the best songs i have heard in long time nothings wrong just as long as you know someday ahhh well , good message behind it i guess every time i look in your eyes i simply fall into your lies it 's fun to try to make up new lyrics to songs helps the creative process i get i just ate some flavored ice and it tastes pretty good although the grape had a strange aftertaste nothing else could affect me like this just your eyes and your deadly kiss words just keep popping into my head i have been listening to this song over and over its actually on repeat my plug only has one socket i was surprised when i first saw that most have two oh well finally , you have returned my mind to me but still you have left me nothing so it 's only been 5 minutes and i have written quite a bit this is slow going i guess water really does not boil if you watch it people do not seem to call me much anymore i guess it might be because i end up calling them but still i do not know , it 's weird i guess this is a lot like writing a journal free consciousness i loved catcher in the rye strange book though i did not like the other big stream of consciousness book i forgot what it was called all i see are visions of your face reminding me all of this was a waste hmmmm my time thing does not show me how long i have left i guess i started at 9 40 so i have 10 minutes left why were not we able nickelback really has some great songs no one , leader of men all seem fairly angry however perhaps that is why i liked them subconscious anger perhaps all you left were remnants of pain tell me what you thought you would gain my nose hurts i should put my ring on for some reason i always forget to put my ring on before going to class i dropped my 427 calc class today and opted for 408d instead i thought perhaps learning second semester was more important than skipping to a higher level of math it 's all about the basics , is not it the only bad thing about this was that i also had to drop my philosophy class as well so i'm down to 13 credit hours this means i have to find something else to do even though i'm working , i kinda feel like i'm being lazy if i do not go back up to at least 15 credit hours i'm only 1 credit hour above the requirement for a full time student perhaps i will take tae kwon do or guitar i think the tae kwon do is only 1 credit hour tho , while guitar is 2 i hope i will still be able to start that would be pretty fun the only thing is i do not really know what kind of exams i would get through those classes perhaps i will talk to the music department tomorrow i have to wake up at 7 tomorrow i do not really feel like going to class at 8 in the morning and my calc class still has it 's discussions at the same time as before so i still wo not get a break until 4 30 tomorrow man , it 's going to be a very long day perhaps it wo not be too bad though maybe i will be able to figure out some way to pass the time this has got to be more than 100 words all i see right now is the finish button it 's calling me slowly , slowly instead of a hollywood horror i also see the logitech sign for my mouse it 's a really good mouse nice and cordless , as well as wireless i know you are wondering when so why do human beings miss such obvious signs pointing out problems do we really miss them or are we just blinding ourselves to them perhaps those are the same things all you gave me were endless problems now show me how to solve them i really like using the , ellipses something like that i always got it messed up i probably overuse them they are nice though they show a pause much more clearly than a comma ( in my mind at least ) also , they are useful in showing sarcasm much sarcasm now the story 's played out like this nothing 's wrong those just seem to stick in my head i do not know for sure why perhaps i see my own relationships in those i think it 's almost been 20 minutes i guess i should probably write for a little bit more just to make sure its been a full 20 minutes
2003_298.txt 1 1 1 0 1 i just had a conversation with sarah she can be so touchy sometimes it seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she ca not stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying just a few minutes before hand , i was telling her about what i need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect , she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that was not pre planned i told her that that was not stream of consciousness because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story then she just got irritated and told me that i do not do that to her and i was like , what she does not make any sense oh dear surat is screaming her head off and i have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight it is 10 30 and she usually starts screaming about now surat is a nice bird though , other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood she usually keeps herself pretty entertained there she goes again i should tell monica to cover her moni is probably busy with her studies how am i supposed to tend to my bird while i am doing this assignment i have to stay here and complete it or then i would not really be doing the assignment right that brings up another point what is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 20 minutes are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break ok , i had to go cover the cage but it did not take more than five seconds ( literally ) because the cage is on the other side of the room that i am in that is a relief now she is not screaming now what should i write about hmmm i had a yoga class today ashtanga yoga it was very difficult to do and very fun i hope to become really flexible this semester i also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester i got a texercise pass from gregory gym for 55 dollars and i have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes it is wonderful i just wish i did not have this psychology class at 3 30 to 5pm because two really good classes go on at that time it is really disappointing i ca not believe i am taking a psychology class ( 301 ) this late into my undergrad i am a senior and i am just taking this class because i decided just recently i want to go into counseling psychology and in order to do that i need 4 psychology classes with a b or higher i am going to make an a in this class this summer had a large effect on me i realized that i really did not want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family i think i just spelled that adequate word incorrectly i hope this assignment is not going to be graded on spelling that would be ridiculous because this is a stream of consciousness paper what if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly this page does not have a spell checker people are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing my sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers that seems so ancient now and that was only about 11 or 12 years ago its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years what is going to happen next i will tell what will happen next we will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left the earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise i think they should study that in psychology why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings we are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources we are causing a great imbalance in nature would they even be able to study that in psychology that might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they do not want to admit how ridiculous humans are or rather , can be i really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology or at least i have more experience in those other two areas i tend to take the middle ground however i am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and i am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment i think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist am i going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology i hope not psychology is a good field , do not get me wrong , but one has to remember that everything has its faults i took that horrible pre test today for the experiments some of the questions were funny to me i think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica haha my 20 minutes are over guess you do not get to read about my opinions on erotica

2003_309.txt 1 1 0 1 0 so this assignment is sort of interesting it 's like your thoughts go faster than you think regardless of the speed at which you type oh , my , that guy in my keyboarding class during my 9th grade year in high school , so sad , i remember he has special assignments because he could not handle writing a paragraph the teacher was lucky if she could get a sentence out of him what was her name i have no idea , i remember seeing her at the mall one day during junior year , and she recognized me probably because i was one of the only kids who took her seriously poor gal , it had to be hard to be ignored like that all of the time at least she was really sweet , so people did not have real hate for her ah , the days at hutchinson i ca not ' believe my roommate is in the longhorn band , actually the flags i wonder if she will quit she does not seem to have the time to devote to it yesterday a returning flag member quit for those reasons i wish she was not so irrational the day she said she was going to quit , and she got that jar of candy so she stayed ! what is that candy does not make you have time let 's be a little more mature here get your lips ready what it 's posted on her computer , i have not quite figured her out yet , i do not know if i ever will my friends seem to hate her from the stories i tell , and i'm not sure if i blame them ah , roommate hell , who does not' experience it at least we are not fighting yet and her stupid camera i ca not ' believe she complains about not having money yet she spent 300 dollars on a digital camera so now she has something else to take up her time , learning how to use it so so so unproductive i wonder if she wants to study for the chemistry test together i hope not , i do not think she is even started the homework and it 's due tonight at 11 , oh , well i should stop worrying for her i have not looked at our fire escape plan , wonder if it 's ever been used i would imagine so with the kitchen downstairs and all , at least the building is only two stories , i guess i have a better chance of getting out this way , in case of a fire my closet light is still on , and i want to turn it off a lot , but i should not get up from the computer so i will just keep thinking about it for the next 14 minutes , oh well , nothing i can do about it now and on the closet light , i ca not believe we had to have a sticky note up by the light switch for a week signifying which switch went to what cristina could not manage to remember that the room light was the bottom one i guess i am just critical of her lack of comprehension and common sense i learned where the word common sense comes from while reading the psychology textbook i bet if i thought about if for a second i would remember what it was i think it was an incorrect believe that involved the word commas i will look it up when i finish i think it was in chapter one i have managed to read so much for that class , but i'm still a little behind , only halfway through chapter four and i'm supposed to be done by 330 this afternoon , i really should read like three chapters of that this weekend , i find it fascinating and i want to read it , but my friends have been getting in the way of my studies that 's probably a bad sign i need to get through to them that i am here to learn having fun just comes naturally and does not require the effort that learning does i agreed with pennebaker in the handout that you have the opportunity to be in two classes if you read the textbook , and i want to it 's like i built up the desire to learn over the summer from doing nothing , absolutely nothing i really should have had a job i made a total of like 200 dollars this whole summer , probably spent like 500 or more i'm so bad about that hopefully i will grow out of that habit through the years of college i have not even written a paper in probably almost four months i hope when i take masterworks of lit i do not have too much analytical writing to do ( false hope ) sigh , candy i really need to watch what i eat , this whole freshman fifteen will really scare a girl more than people would imagine i am not going to let myself get all blubbidy well it 's the word that came to mind and that is what they asked for i wonder if they analyze this crap like how though it would be like measuring how many times people say i , or say something negative ha , i would take the cake on that one i should work on my negativity but that 's not something that can just be changed overnight i should just slowly work on focusing on things more bright and enjoyable if you focus on the negative for too long you become depressed and nothing makes you happy and i'm a little prone to that being as homesick as i am i just miss the people my best friends , people who 's opinions of me are solidly formed and wo not change overnight screw paul ! my stupid friend i met here who 's already decided he does not want to be around me after being full fledged into our friendship he tells me i'm fake and intimidating buck up pal my other friends agreed with me though , i really have not changed much , he just works me up in his head and then i'm just regular old me in person and he gets himself disappointed i hope we do not have any , or many , awkward encounters we should not he is all into his liberal arts stuff and i will never be in that area i love engineering for that i do not have to take many classes in stuff that i am not good at or interested in i do not want to sit around and think about the world and do it in the way i was taught but i do not want to be a snotty engineer who thinks that i'm better because i'm studying math aaaaahhh , i hate college politics already the engineering dean is really really overconfident in the school i could not believe he told us we were better because our overall sat scores were better , duh they were better , the school does not have to accept anyone in the top 10 percent of their high school and the rest of the university does ! bah i ca not take that sort of unfounded confidence and bragging and i think i will encounter it in many of my peers over the next few years that stupid closet light is driving me crazy i want to turn it off so much and i only have to wait another three minutes my roommate 's aim is still on , i bet her cousin , boobs , is thinking i'm her and trying to tease her about enrique i wonder if there are possibilities of this paper being deemed not stream of consciousness and me having to redo it maybe i bet they take a random sample and so some people get caught turning in crap , but others do not , and that guy that pasted the manual just happened to get randomly selected i wonder if they do the 10 percent thing , simply ten percent of the population , oooooh yeah , i learned so much in statistics except i do not think i will ever remember the details mrs perez was such a sweetheart , i hope she is doing alright i miss my high school , for some reason i do not want to type the name of it so awkward not knowing who is going to read this hopefully i wo not be deemed a crazy haha , along with the clingies , creepies , doodlers , boppers , factoids save me and i'm just about done , sad that i kept watching the clock the whole time
2003_311.txt 0 0 0 0 1 okay this is weird i do not like assignments like this one i'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings trying to be somewhat original and all i find is nothing really seems like deep down i am pretty reserved well , actually i know that i am so this is not a surprising anyways , there it is nothing rachel just got home she is my sister she had swim team practice i think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has does that make sense working hard is not her most favorite thing , though i bet you wondering why i am expressing myself so badly it has to do with the fact that english is not my native language i am german my real family is still in germany so rachel is not my real sister she is part of the family i am staying with now i am going blank again let 's talk about the family i am staying with then they are very kind after all , they are not charging me anything why that 's a longer story i think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology there is not anything wrong with her it 's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level the funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity and i am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement but it 's true from what i understand you can blame that on her childhood her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child well , it was her they got accordingly , her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life well , you can derive your own implications anyways , she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is it goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong she goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits anyway , i should be talking about myself i have my own problems i ca not state my feelings that is as far as i will go because i ca not talk about it then it ca not be cured irony now i am thinking about ut it 's pretty overwhelming in germany my high school graduating class had about 70 people yup but i will do fine i am just having these high expectations in college i want to find my dead poet society teacher someone that will point me in the right direction that makes learning an adventure right now , i still have to force myself to do homework time is up !
2003_312.txt 0 1 0 0 0 laughing , sad , wondering why failed dreams , friends , lost ca not seem to get away from people why do people change , what happens later on help everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards people never grow up , promises are never kept life goes on , right learn to live with people learn to get along with those who do not attempt to get along with you what have they sacrificed yet does anything matter except themselves sometimes you just need someone to talk to to let understand where you are coming from does anyone see what 's happening how long until everything 's back to normal again how long until i can trust what went wrong somewhere , i lost the truth , reason , my smile , yet still i hurt and cry and need i love this boy but why is he the only one that provides comfort it ca not be healthy , can it how come no one else seems adequate anymore life has to keep moving does not it but why do things work out this way what happens in the future where does all of this lead questions , questions , questions i feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me college changes people , and some people grow , yet some people stay right where they were to begin with why do not people understand , or listen , or care overwhelmed , just overwhelmed things have not clicked yet lonely very lonely , need someone to talk to , really talk to and not just over the phone every night , not someone who knows who you are , or someone who cares about you , just someone who will listen and then talk back who does not care if you drink this weekend , and wo not judge you by your mistakes or jealousy , or stupidity , or friends why do people always compare you to your friends ca not you just be you , you do not have to have the same values as your friends , the same beliefs , or the same morals , yet people always seem to worry about you when it 's one of your friends who screwed up hate disgust disapproval attention i need a hug , i just need to be held while i vent or cry , i need to cry to let everything out , but then i read that venting is not proven to be healthy , but was it proven to be unhealthy and yet vitamins supposedly do not help you but they make you feel better , so ca not i vent and cry just so i feel better why do not people change do i have a one track mind why do i care so much maybe i'm the one who needs to change , maybe i need to try out what 's bothering me so much , but maybe i do not i want my own bed , i want my privacy , is it too much to ask for her stuff not to be thrown on my bed all the time , ca not she set it on hers so that i do not have to move it in order to go to sleep , and if you come in at one in the morning and the lights are off , do not leave them on when you leave five minutes later , especially when someone 's sleeping i'm hurt , i feel hurt , and betrayed and i question a lot now , because i used to think that i knew who she was , she used to be a really close friend that i could talk to about anything , yet now all i see is someone in need of constant attention so how do i know who any of my friends are or my boyfriend do i really know who he is i think i do but what if something goes wrong and i lose him , my best friend , also what if he gets tired of listening to me , and gets tired of my friends or finds someone else , or gets tired of having to support me i'm high maintenance but is that bad , and not in the fashion that i like gifts , i do not really , i just like being held and talked to and spoiled i guess you call it i really do not know where it all comes from i just expect more in a best friend so that it 's harder to live up to so that there 's less a change of being hurt or quit on or left behind , or scared or in love , but what is love anyway
2003_313.txt 1 1 1 1 1 i'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment it 's only been 17 seconds , i have a long way to go my stupid brother keeps instant messaging me , i wish he would go away there 's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday , that was pretty good i wonder what we will eat tonight i'm tired of jester pizza it 's really not that good now it 's only been a minute and 37 seconds 40 seconds stupid kid keeps i'm ing me good now he signed off my roommate is reading the fourth harry potter book and i can hear her turning the pages she is also drinking something and sipping really loudly , which is really getting annoying , but i do not know if i should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it 's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already i have been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it 's almost completely lost it 's flavor my sandal just fell off and i wonder where it went my roommate stopped sipping whatever it was i think it was soup who drinks soup out of a cup are not you supposed to use a spoon maybe we are out of spoons that 's no good i'm going home this weekend so maybe i will get my mom to buy us some new spoons my phone is ringing and i'm pretty sure it 's my ex boyfriend keith but i'm not going to answer it i will probably tell him it 's because i'm writing this , but i really just do not feel like talking to him right now his new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together , but i do not really want to i do not like being the plan b i do not think it 's very fair the page scrolled down enough that i ca not see how much time has passed i'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes does this thing stop when it 's 20 minutes now my roommate is writing something my foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class probably was not a smart choice of shoes oh well i wonder when that water bottle is from yesterday i think my printer has a blue button i'm getting kind of bored of this and i do not really like to type i hate e mail and instant message and all that garbage why ca not people just call you on the phone it 's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they are being sarcastic or not sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy now i'm staring at the wall it 's a painted brick kind of wall , which is probably smart of whoever designed this place , but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up we tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere my best friend kristyn got a bunch of them for me too bad she is not here we are going out to dinner tomorrow night , no the night after anyway , friday night is when we are going out to dinner i have not seen her in a week , which i'm sure does not sound like a long time , but she used to be my neighbor when i lived at my parents house so i'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday she is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here i always forget the name of it , but it 's supposed to be not very far away from campus now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap i think if i reread this , i would probably think i was crazy all of this is pretty random i want the phone to ring because now i'm in the mood to talk to him he is not very nice sometimes , but sometimes he really is i think this is probably a bad situation he wants us to be friends he is a good friend , he is just not very good at being anything more than friends he is not a very good people person i guess my roommate is rolling around in her bed , it 's kind of distracting i have a pencil from the greensheet and i do not remember where i got or who could have possibly left it here where did it come from do people actually read the greensheet i have never seen someone reading it kinda weird my mom works for the austin american statesman , but she does not write or take pictures or anything like that , she works in hr time must be almost up ha , it does tell me when this is over !
2003_315.txt 1 0 0 0 0 well , i am now officially writing my first college paper more or less it is really hot outside today i wonder when it is going to cool of so i wo not swear so bad when i walk to class i think that i need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when i get them , instead of putting them off it makes me feel like i am bogged down when i have a lot of stuff to do at once it is actually really stressful i kind of like this song that is on the radio busta rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper , but i think that this song is ok pharrell really makes this song what it is now come to think of it i do not think that busta rhymes sang that song oh well i guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes , so i wo not correct my mistake my chair is pretty comfortable hopefully i will do my homework in it when i am done with this writing assignment the longhorns really kicked new mexico state 's butt i think that chance mock ( the quarterback ) got to a ruff start , but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the longhorn 's quarterback although vincent young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal , scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts , and throwing a great 60 yard pass , i believe that mock should continue to start as qb because he has put in his time as scout team player my , that was a really long sentence i am tired of eating the food at the jester food court they have a big selection , but the selections never change at each station i kinda miss my mom 's home cooking i can get over that i was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus , but i guess that i did not think that i would see so many people going to class everyday i kind of feel like a minority in austin coming from a small town in east texas that is mostly white , black , and mexican , i am not used to seeing so many asian students i am not against asian people at all , i just have never seen so many at one setting such as ut the temperature in my dorm is not to my liking i am a very hot natured person , and i prefer that it be cold in my room being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling i dislike sweating when i sleep i need to go to the gym today i am getting out of my routine of working out each day i need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play it is kind of hard to be disciplined once you do not have your parents to tell you what to do the experience at ut is a good one though and i am not complaining the only thing i dislike about it right now is that i still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks the co op did not have my mis book today like that re order said nothing is ever perfect that is not a bad thing though i hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy czar this is an easy grade there are so many fine girls here at ut everywhere you look you see a hottie i love that some of them seem fake to me though , but i know that i should not judge people my phone is ringing and i am almost done alright i am done later
2003_316.txt 1 0 0 1 0 right now i just sat down to type this psychology paper this is the first time i have ever typed a paper like this before , with constant writing i am used to gathering my thoughts , thinking before i speak but now i am writing whatever pops into my mind i am thinking about how much this different from something i would do in high school being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing i am hearing the faint sound of the houston astros baseball game in the background , i love baseball so much , this the pennant races are incredible hopefully i will get to broadcast the game i love in the future well i have an hour until its time to go to work , its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college astros , i think still losing 3 2 someone just flied out i'm enjoying the fact that i am able to do this from my own computer , god i would hate to live in a dorm sharing and small places are no fun for me looking forward to this weekend , big barbecue put on by my friend mike we always have legendary times at those its just starting to sink in now as i hear god bless america in the background that today is september 11 it 's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago , it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago i really do not agree with what is going on in our country right now , by the way the wind is blowing pretty good outside right now , for some reason i have not opened the blinds in the house yet i get really lazy when i am at home anyway , this a little easier than i thought it would be it has really gotten me thinking i mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking , and are we thinking about something all the time consciously well i think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3 2 , i really hope we do not lose to milwaukee man i do not want to go to work today , although 4 9 30 is not that bad , better than 12 9 30 i feel like i am writing in a journal more than doing a project , that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page big props to the person who set that up i was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment , but i quickly realized that was not necessary i just found out i have discussion section class for geography i do not get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section i do not get what that is all about , is it for the ta 's to feel important or something must be a college thing , i guess it seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now i just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that i have about a minute left i hope i did alright on this , i mean i wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts p s ( i submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code my class code is 316 not 315 )
2003_318.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i want to listen to more music i do not know what song to download next but oh well i love listening to music when i study i wonder why i like listening to rock and alternative that is weird i guess most people would listen to classical or other soothing music but i like studying to louder , cooler music i guess that makes me weird i wonder how things are going at home i want to go back this weekend , but i know that i ca not i have a lot of work i want to do , and i really want to finish my calculus before the due date i should sign up for tutoring down at jester so far the class has been ok though i understand what the teacher is saying , and i am not having that much trouble with my homework i hope my boyfriend comes to see me this weekend but i know that he is going to be really busy with his internship he has to finish it soon so that he can pay more attention to his school work i guess i may be asking to much of him i do not want to pressure him to come , so maybe i wo not mention it i still wish he could come though i wonder how molina is doing she is like 5 months already she is getting pretty big i wonder if she knows that natalie is having twins so many girls are pregnant back home , that is kinda sad most of them are really smart , and they could have done so much with their lives i'm cold i wish i could turn of the air conditioner well , at least it 's better than it being hot norma still has not figured out how to turn off her alarm yet it keeps beeping every hour it is getting on my nerves i wonder if i take the batteries out if she would mind i'm thirsty i should get some water but i do not want water , but that is all i have i need to get a job i do not know how i am going to pay for the spring semester i can barely pay for the housing as it is i need more money i hope everything is going ok at the ranch we need the place to do better , or if not than one of us is going to have to quit school i do not want to quit , but if it comes down to one of us having to leave , then i would rather it be me my brother is doing well , and my sister only has a year to go i have only barely started , i can wait a bit longer to go to school till then , i can help out at home , and work with my parents at our restaurant my foot went to sleep i should move so it can wake up i have so much work to do today i need to study and reads a lot of stuff for class i wonder how my friends are doing in class i want to see vanessa she should have told me that she got married 2 weeks ago she said she forgot to tell me that she had gotten married that is a stupid reason how can someone forget that they had gotten married i wo not get mad though i am happy for her i wonder if manny will ever ask me to marry him sure we have talked about it , and we both have said we want to spend the rest of our lives together , but still knowing him , he will get very nervous and scared and not want to ask me because i could say no it is just like when he wanted to ask me out i knew he liked me and he knew i liked him , but he could not ask me so i finally made him ask me i said , we are not going anywhere until you ask me so he finally did i hope him asking me to marry him wo not be the same way that is definitely not how i picture my future husband proposing well my time is almost up , but i need to keep going norma is back in the room she can never get her days straight she just left again i guess she is going to the bathroom wow , time is almost really up time flies by when you are just typing what your thinking i think that is really cool oh well my time is up now but i am still thinking i have pretty much said my life 's story , that is really weird i thought all i would put down was how my day had gone you know , like a lot of crap just to fill up space i should stop now because i have a lot more things to do i think i will stop now

2003_320.txt 1 1 0 0 0 well , i do not exactly know why i'm doing this , but i do enjoy the idea of trying to figure out what 's in this head of mine sharon 's checking her email , but she will be leaving soon to go get a bagel i'm not that hungry because i had a huge breakfast there are a lot of people in this library i wish i had internet connection at home because it would be so convenient i wonder what my parents are doing right now i wonder if their business is doing well i wonder when they will be able to retire i wonder when god will essentially allow them to stop working god works in mysterious ways , and that 's what makes him god i suppose i'm really glad i got to talk to paul last night online he is a nice guy i got to talk to carol too , but really did not have much to say , which is not surprising there 's a lot of interesting different people here at ut such a contrast from plano west , where everyone wants to be popular and only buys the best things in life but are the things they think are the best really the best do not think so i miss home , but i really do enjoy it here at austin i have not been homesick at all , which might be a good thing or a bad thing i feel like i abuse my parents so much , verbally i do not ever take into consideration the fact that they have feelings too i just say whatever to them and never think clearly in a sense it is good to be comfortable with people , but being completely immune to their well being is not good at all why am i such a malicious person i think sometimes being malicious on purpose might be better than being malicious without even thinking , because then that means that being malicious has become second nature i really need to work out more often i have gotten so freaking lazy , and as a result , fatter , or healthy as my parents call it why am i so frugal , actually it should not even be considered frugality because it 's to the point of stinginess , like scrooge i do not get it i try to not think about how much money i spend , but i get so greedy and selfish i seriously think that if food was not so essential to life i would probably not eat and horde money all day why god actually i should not be questioning you i'm sorry it 's my fault i am just an evil person that 's it we are all just naturally evil well , that sounds too hobbes like we do have good in us , but we are all sinners no doubt but i seem like my sins all go unnoticed because i do them so often and i do not realize it anymore i have got 10 minutes left on this shar 's going to the restroom i have so much reading to do and sometimes i feel like i read and read and read and study , but then when i get to class i feel like i did nothing at all wow , 10 minutes is a pretty long time not when watching television or a movie i guess time does fly when you are having fun i wonder who thought that one up i have not seen a movie in the theater in awhile i wish there was a dollar theater close by i wish i could get a job i wish i could manage my time better i should really take into account opportunity costs of everything i do or buy sometimes i wish i was more economically conscious but then i feel like sometimes i'm too economically conscious i do too many things for my own good i never think about other people instead , i think how much of my own money , energy , etc is going into making someone else happy that 's so wrong man , i have psych in about an hour i wonder what we will talk about i wonder if i read enough i wonder how my first quiz in college will be like tomorrow i really need to stop eating so much and work out more i cannot possibly rationalize all my eating by my walking to and from school everyday 5 more minutes i wonder what god thinks of me maybe i should not wonder what else is there to say i feel like my brain has been racked and pried is that how you spell the past tense of pry i have so much reading to do did i mention that by the time i get home , i will probably be so tired but i need to read shar 's going to her echo meeting so i will be home alone with no internet access man i am so spoiled as early as 1 2 years ago i did not depend so highly on technology but look at me now well , i guess we should look at ourselves now what to say i wonder what my parents think of me i think too much about what other people think of me i need to stop and think about what i think about myself i thought that girl looked familiar hmm i'm almost done dude almost done only 1 minute left i have written a lot well at least i feel like it now that i'm almost done i feel like the 20 minutes went by really fast so i guess this was both enriching and entertaining to see what 's in my brain 10 seconds done !
2003_321.txt 1 1 0 0 1 i'm a little nervous about doing this right now because i have to wake up at 445 tomorrow morning for crew practice my back hurts it 's from rowing on the orgs , or whatever they call them i am not a good typist i have to look down at my hands , and i go so slowly this really is a skill i should have mastered by college i feel like an idiot i'm frustrated with russell i do not really want to go to church on sunday because i know he will be there i wonder if brad really did not call me for a week because i told him he was moving to fast or if it was because he was really sick i ca not believe i saw travis today i wonder if he really will ever give me a call doubtful , seriously doubtful i need to turn on my lamp , i ca not see and this computer screen is starting to hurt my eyes i ca not believe that nik really did not call me today even though his name showed up on my phone how bizarre ! i do not know how to spell bizaar oh well my left shoulder muscle is hurting i think it 's because of the position i'm laying in this is taking forever i'm only at 6 minutes ouch i just leaned up and turned on the lamp much better i can actually see the keys , even though you would not be able to tell it by the way i'm still typing so messily my ponytail is kinda digging into the back of my head dangit i hate that i cuss now it makes me feel kinda dirty not like skank dirty , but like not so clean dirty that movie , thirteen , we saw at dobie tonight was weird weird weird i ca not decide if i liked it at all or not it was really disturbing when they showed her cutting herself it reminded me of kate when she did that the one wednesday i called her she was so upset about brad boys are dumb i do not know why we fall for them so easily i mean it 's got to be our need of acceptance and the comfort warmth they bring when they hold us , but i ca not imagine finding a guy who will actually care about me and not just want to feel me up i mean really what 's going on in their heads ( or most likely , pants ) that makes them so desensitized to us josh is wonderful the way he told catherine he loved her the first time , the way he just spent 600 dollars on her for her birthday i'm so jealous , i do not know what to do it 's dangerous having him as a best friend he is just so damn wonderful i mean , really , any even remotely smart girl would fall for him in a freaking' heartbeat ! sometimes i ca not stand it he has not written to me since i have gotten to school i'm not a happy girl camper i know he is getting ready to go on his nature expedition survival trip , but why has not he had a chance to write me yet i have been waiting for him to write me , but maybe he is just waiting for me to write so he can respond i will write him this weekend anyway , along with emily , mary , caleb and edward i have to get my hollow core door too i do not even know where to get it i will ask zara tomorrow i'm going to have to get online to find directions to a home depot or lowes i hate not knowing my way around it totally sucks that 's why i loved beaumont so much it was small enough to where i knew where most of the big things were and if i did not know where they were , it was not that hard to find it here there are massive highways , freeways , loops , overpasses all designed to confuse and terrify the new to austin driver i wish russ and i were okay enough that i could ask him to take me to do my errands after church oh well i still do not think i'm comfortable enough to be around him i'm cold it 's weird that i have not slept under my covers for the last week i have just slept under a fleece blanket on top of it my time is almost up good night my dear diary assignment i hope you go over well i'm exhausted , and i ca not wait to turn out the lights i have to get up in 6 hours ick
2003_322.txt 0 0 1 1 0 i'm starting to feel tired and lazy that sandwich for lunch really hit the spot and now i feel really comfortable as i sit in this chair and look at the screen i feel somewhat hypnotized and just relaxed i feel like taking a nap because the temperature is slightly warm and it is making me slow down i'm thinking about going to gregory but i feel so relaxed that i probably wo not go its such a long walk and then i have to come back to my room before i go to another class i wish my dorm room was closer to gregory , then i think i would go more often instead i always tell myself i'm going to go but most of the time i just put it off my back is sore and i think i need to stretch it , my legs are also sore i know it has to be from all the walking in between classes i ca not wait for tonight monday night football my night to sit on the couch and watch tv i wonder who is playing i think its the eagles and bucaneers , but i'm not sure i think the bucaneers have a real good shot of repeating and winning the super bowl again this year i know for sure the cowboys are going to be bad they will finish around 6 to 7 wins if they win more , it will be a successful year for them i wonder where my roommate is he always leaves the lights on in our room , so i know he has been home and left already i really wish i was done for the rest of the day and did not have another class i would definitely take a nap naps are so key they are rejuvenating beyond anything else my hair is always in my eyes i think its time for me to finally get it cut its annoying now , its too hot to have long hair in my face also it looks kind of shaggy i'm taking my shoes off that feels better ooh that blister on the bottom of my foot looks pretty bad ill have to put another band aide on it i need to start playing basketball more so i wo not get blisters when i just play on occasions the only problem is that there are usually too many people that want to play , so i never get the chance to practice my shot so in the games i end up missing most of the time fortunately the competition is not real high at gregory although i have seen brian boddicker and sidwell harris up there at times i ca not believe the basketball coach would allow them to play in pickup games like that what if they got hurt he would be infuriated how would you tell the coach that you broke your ankle and were out for the season just because you were in some stupid pickup game does not sound right you know what else is not right , chance mock starting t quarterback texas 's offense is so predictable with chance at qb run cedrick benson up the middle once or twice for minimal yardage and then we are in a third and long and everybody in the stadium knows we have to throw it that is when chance gets sacked or throws an incomplete pass and we have to punt it on the other hand when vince young is at qb , you ca not predict what is going to happen he is much more of a threat he can run , scramble , elude tacklers and throw also , at least that is what he did against new mexico st i know its the aggies of new mexico st that we played last week but he did better than chance mock against the same guys so i think he deserves the start against arkansas this upcoming week i ca not wait to rub it into mic 's face when we beat them i hope he finds a ticket and can come down from arkansas for the game he will definitely be intimidated by the texas crowd how long has it been since i have done my laundry not since i left home i think i really do not want to do laundry in my dorm room it takes too long i think i'm just going to take all my dirty clothes with me whenever i go home probably around homecoming , which is the same weekend as the texas ou game i ca not believe i did not get a ticket for that that really pisses me off i did get lucky though with my season tickets , section 20 row 7 , right behind the cannon that was a pretty good draw for a freshman still , ill have to find a way to get a ticket to the texas ou game best game all year in all of college football and we better win this year or else mack brown should be fired that would be the fourth year in a row he can recruit like its nobody 's business but he ca not develop that talent and fit them into a game plan that can make us win the big game straight up he gets out coached every time by bob stoops what a stud my fingers are getting a little tired from typing
2003_323.txt 0 0 0 0 0 i got to pee i do not know how long i can hold it maybe i should of went to the restroom before i started this thing oh well , it 's all good man my neck is still sore from lifting weights on tuesday , and i need to lift again today , i really need to stop being lazy so i can get strong and get in shape i hope i can get notes from the class i missed today , that 's already been twice i missed the same class and we have only been in school for less than 2 weeks man i really need to start picking it up it do not make any sense to send in a transcript for a scholarship when my transcript does not exist at this school yet what am i supposed to do also transcripts are 10 a piece plus a 1 75 if you use a credit card it 's stupid man my hands are starting to hurt , 20 minutes is a lot longer than i thought i need to figure out something to do on saturday , i mean this is austin plenty to do , but choosing what to do is kind of hard especially when you do not have any money i am getting tired , about to fall asleep after i finish this , but i got to do that math homework so i do not have to worry about it later i just heard a weird sound , i think it was my stomach but i just ate so it ca not be that i am hungry , maybe it is just digesting some food oh man another 10 minutes to go , they should have shortened these writing assignments to 10 minutes when i would be done by now ha ha ha , that 's pretty funny , ha ha ha i wonder what they are going to think of my thoughts , it ca not be that bad , but what was up with that pre testing for the experiment requirement , it took forever and a day man i wish this school were closer to my home back in el paso i already kind of miss home , i think i might be homesick , but i have not thrown up or cried so i am not sure man i still got to pee i do not see how they say this school has the best looking girls compared to all other colleges , because i have only seen a few girls that are cute and few that are really cute , maybe i just have not seen all of them in this gigantic school , i swear i am going to have strong ass legs by the time the semester is over from all this walking oh yea there is that girl that looks like raven , now that girl looks good , i really need to stop being shy and talk to that girl who knows she might give me a chance , you never know then there is also that girl in math class , she is real cute too , but i have talked to her , but i need to get to know her better what should i do tonight i could play basketball in gregory or volleyball downstairs here at jester , so much to do so little time i am almost done , then i can go pee , and go do my math homework in jay jason 's room since they have the book that 's stupid that you have to buy the solutions manual with the book , i just wanted a used book , but no they did not have any oh well it is cheaper to just use jay 's book when i need it , besides i only use it for homework anyways oh man this thing is over , and i really need to go to the bathroom
2003_329.txt 1 1 1 1 1 it is really bright in here maybe i should turn on of the lights off i would except i'm writing a stream of consciousness i really miss byron i just talked to him about 10 minutes ago , but i need to talk to him again boy , is my cell phone bill going to be high this month haha i still have not paid mom for last months bill i probably should have read chapter 3 before starting this , since it is due tomorrow and this is not due until the 12th , but i would more than likely had waiting until the last minute if i had not gotten this over now whoops my poster looks like it is about to fall down oh well , i'm to tired to go and put it back up yet , i am still awake enough to sit here and type for 20 minutes i wonder how much people write for this if they are slow typers and i wonder if they read every one of these especially since mine is going to be so long because of my typing speed man , if i were a slow typer this would be a lot less work and if i was not so diligent about punctuation , capitalization , and spelling haha instead of spelling i accidentally wrote sleeping and had to erase it i wonder if that is my subconscious trying to tell me something i'm so glad i finished that photo wall it turned out really nice , but stephanie did not seem to like it too much because she did not have quite as many pictures as i did to put up oh well , that 's her problem man , my dvd 's are really out of order i'm not sure why i think they need to be in any order at all , because in the grand scheme of things , that really does not matter quite that much you know what would really suck would be if my computer , out of the blue caught a virus while i was in the middle of this , and i would have to start all over again then i would just wait until the last minute and probably not type quite so much oh well , this is for science i guess man i really really miss byron i ca not believe i got so upset today when i was driving home , but what can you do when you love somebody so much i do not know how his brother is related to him , he is so strange at least he is nice i guess i wonder if his blindness was caused from his genes or from some other problem when he was born i guess that really is not my business , but i'm just so damn curious byron did not seem to know , so i guess i will never find out unless i ask him , and i do not know him quite well enough to do that man , my pinky is really starting to cramp up i do not think i have written for 8 minutes straight before without taking a break i hope my calculus quiz tomorrow is not bad , i did the homework and everything and my professor swears that it is enough preparation for his quizzes , but yet i still remain cynical i guess i will just go over the homework problems again before i go to sleep i ca not wait until that royal 's show comes on a and e wow , i was so lazy i did not even bother to find the and symbol haha i did it again if i was not on this laptop i would not have a problem finding it i wish it came with a 10 key pad byron byron i ca not stop thinking about that boy he is such a sweet heart , and i ca not wait to finish college so i can spend all my time with him i wonder where a e is haha i found the symbol i wonder if there is some way that i can find out the channels on the internet through ut 's website man this is a hell of a lot of typing hey hey , i see my monkees bobble heads they are so strangely entertaining that 's the only reason why i'm going to watch the a e special , ( davy jones is on it wahoo ) that , and because byron said he was going to watch it there 's the picture i have of us ! i ca not stop looking at it or thinking about him ! i'm sure whoever ( if anyone ) reads this will wonder who byron is ( though it 's pretty obvious ) i hope archie allows him to stay over at his dorm so he can come visit next weekend , and i do not have to drive back to san antonio again i do not mind driving down there , it might just be nice to have a change of scenery and have byron visit up here i'm going to be so worried about him though because he has to wait until he gets off of work to drive up here there are to many drunk people out on the street for him to be safe , even though i trust his driving abilities i think i will have him call periodically on his way up here , just so i know that he is alright ya , that 's a good idea i should probably go and put those batteries into my remote but i do not want to get up and find it , nor am i suppose to get up from this typing and do something else man , steph drank all my hi c or did i drink it all naw steph did i distinctly remember having at least 2 left in there when i left on thursday i do not drink her stuff oh wait , i did but she told me i could have some man , that whip cream i got on my face earlier from the frappacino still has not come off after washing my face twice i can still smell it eww it smells like babies vomit byron ! why are not you here with me right now ! i know why you are not here , but i wish you were ! someday i wo not have to worry about where you are all the time , and wonder what you are doing , but for right now this is torture ! especially since i am writing all my thoughts down , and these thoughts of you are more obvious to me than normal ! all the thought i have in between are meaningless because i do not consciously notice them , but when i'm thinking about you it takes all my concentration and full attention ! i should probably try and not think about missing you during class , but i ca not stop it is not like i do not mind these ideas , i just know that i wo not be paying attention to what i should be hurray i'm almost out of time 19 minutes and a few seconds steph needs to put her stuff away and keep it away from my side of room what is up with this i'm not going to clean up after her i'm getting so annoyed with her sleeping habits , but what can i do i love you byron ! i want to drive up there right now but i ca not because of class !
2003_330.txt 0 0 1 1 1 this is my first writing assignment i'm watching cosby on tv i have a headache i have had a headache most of today i woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep i had a stomach ache and felt like i was going to be sick i had a headache and did not feel like doing anything so i got back in bed for a little bit then went over to the san jac food place for some oj that worked out pretty good i think for breakfast i think from now on on mwf i will just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus that class is going pretty good i was supposed to have a study group tonight but i called everyone and nobody could go so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up could not make it but i do not really need it i think i will be doing more teaching than learning in that study group i had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the ap test so i will take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since i'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff i was thinking about switching majors to psych cause i really enjoyed everything i learned in high school when i took it i do not know if i will switch over though yet i'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we will just see where the year goes all day i have felt like crap and i miss my best friend mariko so much especially today since i have felt bad she always makes me feel better it 's really tough being here at college 2 1 2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks i would come home every weekend if i had my car up here but my mom did not let me bring my car up this year i would pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it 's not part of the college experience i do not care about the experience i'm here to learn and i do that during the week i do all my homework when i need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends so why ca not i come home and spend my time with the one person i want to spend time with well i know people here that have offered me rides so i can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko my mom was mad this past weekend cause i spent most of my time with mariko and my mom said she did not bring me home just to hang out with her well from now on i will get rides home from other people so i can spend my time with who i want since my mom wo not be wasting her time driving and getting me i feel bad for thinking that , but that 's just how i feel i love my mom and everything , but i'm not really close to her at all , and i have been introduced to religion through mariko and mariko has always made me feel better no matter what and she is always helped me through anything and i am completely comfortable around mariko and feel completely at ease i'm so close to mariko and i love her so much and it 's just hard being away from her she goes to japan every summer with her family i have been thinking about going next summer i would have to talk with her parents about that though but that would cost me about 1000 dollars for the ticket and i would have to stay with mariko 's family in japan otherwise i would not be able to afford a hotel for a month so that would cost me a ton of money , and then i have been thinking about going on a mission for the church also i really want to go my mom 's really against the religion i have joined she is just heard too many things that are not true and i hate how she feels but through religion i have learned how to deal with all these feelings and i'm comforted now and i forgive my mom for how she feels because she just does not know any better i'm kind of tired and i still have a headache i want something to drink the vending machines at the building were all sold out last time i checked , and right now i do not want to walk back down there 2 floors to find out i do not ' feel like a sprite either , i could go down to san jac again i think they are closed though my shoulders have been hurting lately my neck really hurts too my neck just started today but my shoulders have been hurting for a while usually after sitting in a class after an hour i need to move around more or something i guess my hands are freezing cold there 's no thermostat in my room so it 's always freezing and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and i ca not stand it i put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and i put it up again so hopefully it all stays up there were already some damages to the ceiling so i guess i wo not be charged for anything the sticky things that are not supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some but i do not think it matters oh well i have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms some on the bulletin board over my bed i like waking up with pictures of mariko right there i miss her so much i hope she had a good day today last night she did not seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework i do not know sometimes she just goes through phases i wish i could help her more but there 's not much i can do she just needs to learn to love herself and know that she is a good person and that she is loved sometimes it just gets tough for her and that 's a whole other reason i want to be home still so i can be there with her physically to help her feel better when she is down we still talk online all the time and i call sometimes it 's hard to find times to call though either she will have band till 530 or church or school during the day and then i have classes at certain times so i ca not just leave and call her but i'm going to try and find a couple times a week to call tomorrow 's thursday already so i do not think i will get a couple calls in this week i will call on the weekend though since i wo not be going home this weekend hopefully i meet some people at church this weekend and at the friday lunch and speaker thing at the institute i seem to be the youngest person there and i'm already not a talkative person , so i think it 's going to be kinda hard to meet people oh well 10 seconds left for this thing hopefully the rest of the year goes well

2003_338.txt 1 1 0 1 0 i am typing this paper because i have to my roommate is asleep i am listening to incubus music i am listening to incubus i just got off the phone with my girlfriend she was annoying me she was saying all this stuff about how i was flirting with this fat girl and i was like what i did not flirt with the fat girl and we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument but in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good the music i am listening to is so good i love listening to them i am so mad i did my calculus homework tonight and i missed a few problems it makes me angry because my roommate and i both know calculus and i should have gotten them all right i missed a few which was stupid , but i corrected them but still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid if you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a 100 to a 100 which makes no sense i am so mad at this stupid grading system because then i can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot i am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it and i messed up on my homework so it is not a good night i cannot wait for this week to be over i am having a bad week the song i am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type i really have to go to the bathroom i wish i could go oh well , the music is good i really like this writing assignment because i can write about whatever i want i wish all writing assignments were like this it is so cool to be able to write about anything i love writing about what i am thinking , it is almost like a diary it is good to be able to write about my feelings , i think this assignment is very good i hope my girlfriend is not mad , i just thought about that we talked tonight , and i think she might be mad with some of the stuff that i told her i really hope she is not because i love her with all my heart , i hope she is nor going to blow anything
2003_340.txt 1 1 0 0 0 okay , i just got done chatting with a guy who i had some classes with in high school i have not talked to him in a few months he is doing well but is going to tech what a mistake i was also thinking about yesterday because it marked one year since i would left for venezuela i ca not believe it was a year ago yesterday when i started my time there i miss it so much and would love to return there are so many things the country has to offer and see granted there are lots of political problems and i just received the other day from the embassay down there a letter that said there are cases of yellow fever ( or something like that ) in some of the states i was down there for 10 months i lived with two families i went with the rotary youth exchange program i had a rough time for a few months the hardest time was when there was a nation wide strike which lasted for 2 months ! everything during that time was shut down companies stop producing ran out of harina pan y cervezas tenemos q hablar en ingles o es espanol bien quiero practicar escribiendo mi espanol porque ahora aqui no hay muchas vezes donde puedo escribir cual cosa en espanol my spanish is not perfect far from it i have been speaking for about 7 8 months now the first 4 months i was there i spoke mostly english that is a horrible thing to do if you are trying to learn another language one reason i did not learn in the first four months was because the first host family that i had lived with spoke english , and there family members spoke english i met so many people who knew english that is awful for me because everyone wanted to speak and practice there english with me i wanted to practice spanish when i would try and speak in spanish with my host family they would respond to me in english so the first 4 months were not the best i started to learn slowly thought once i made more friends and once i had switched families my second family was great ! my host mom was so nice to me and she would always talk to me and be more involved with me i started speaking and understanding the language more so by the time i left i had been speaking spanish for about 6 months , i wonder how much better i would be if i had spoke and learned during the first four mouths i broke away from the rotary program in june and traveled alone for that month no one could travel with me , that was okay though because i was not going to miss out on seeing venezuela for that reason one reason why no one could go with me was because there was no money and the eco system had gotten so bad because of that shit head president chavez he even stopped selling american dollars so i had to end up paying the black market prices for my trips that i went on in june , because the trips where priced in dollars well i paid because its a once in a life time opportunity i went to canaima it was truly breathtaking ! i was so shocked to see how beautiful something could be i absolute loved it and wished someone was there to share that sight with me well , in canaima there are lots of waterfalls i went to the famous angel waterfalls which are the tallest in the world it was amazing ! i had to take a four hour bout ride there and then it was an hour walk up to the falls they were great , spectacular i truly recommend going there and at least once in your life i also went to santo sapo , which is the frog or toad falls i got to walk underneath the waterfall ! it was like in the movie the last of the mohicans but 100 times better ! that was my favorite part i also went to a national park called morrocoy they have the best beaches and little islands i went to the islands which were basically empty only for the people who went there during the day it was gorgeous beautiful clear water , great blue sky i loved ever second i also made it out to aruba which is not part of venezuela but its only a 15 min plane ride from the city i had lived in aruba was like the islands in morroccoy that i had gone to it had a great night life atmosphere as well i had a blast ! i ca not wait to go back and visit all of venezuela ! i miss all the wonderful , kind people there i returned the 1 of july , and have been back for 2 months i miss it but i have to get my college started here ca not wait till i have money to go back college is free there here its too damn much i already have way to much in loans , i wo not say how much but let me say you could buy a good car with the amount i have in loans well ciao ! fuera chavez vive venezuela ! te amo y extrano ! cuidate

2003_344.txt 0 1 0 0 0 last week i took a chinese clep test it started out very well , i understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions as you know , the cantonese language is written in two different formats one way , the tradition way , was the one i learned since i was a little kid the other format was a newer , i believe it originated in hong kong or something , was much like the original except more scribbled looking anyways , i opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me so i spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words then , i decided to just skip through to the end that is when i figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format damn it ! was the first words that rushed through my mind , along with a whole stream of foul consciousness but of course , that was last week , and i already have my results back from the test i believe i did relatively well relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests today , monday , is the first day i have been to my rlm biology discussion , thus making the actual first full week of school i must say , i am completely exhausted biology discussion was quite an episode we had an ta that had a really really bad accent much worse , he tried to give an oral review , and when he asked questions , everyone in the class stared at him blankly some ventured a guess softly , but the entire process took most of the discussion period then we took a quiz , which i found to be a bit difficult because i did not understand teh oral review i had to buy books today spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that i probably wo not be needing much i could have found many many other uses for that 129 , but this is college , land of the rich and prosperous , haha geez , look at my grammar in this essay , i think my english teacher would have a heart attack psych class was pretty interesting today dr pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class i was completely fascinated by the experiment too bad i ca not say the same for my philosophy class its not a boring class , its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice , almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep and so i obeyed i notice that when i'm sleeping in class , my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby but of course , i wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever you can definitely tell at what point in the lecture i crashed the funniest part is , i lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class , wishing him good luck i think since i have been here at ut for the fall , i have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about i have been wondering about how my friends have been doing , wherever they went i worry about other stupid things that i feel the need not to bring up at this moment however , i have not been worrying enough about schoolwork i have been recreating too much this weekend though , we went to barton springs to see a friend that came up to visit us from utsa barton springs was nothing like i had imagined i absolutely loved it everything except the coldass water then on the trip back , with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face , it felt so good it felt like summer again of course , i had enrolled in the ut summer program a little bit of work , but a lot less crowd i miss summer

2003_349.txt 0 0 0 1 0 as i look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says 12 26am on september 11 i am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago they still should strike a painful memory in every americans life i remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment i also feel a little stress with all of the homework that college brings along with it austin is so much different than my hometown of lubbock , and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it however , i have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far i cannot wait to say that i am a graduate of the university of texas that will mean so much to me and my family , since it will be an amazing accomplishment i just remembered that my laundry basket is full , and i need to do that sometime before friday since i may be leaving town for a pat green concert hopefully , the laundry room at the end of my floor , 6th in jester west , will not be full surely i can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that i did not complete i sure hope i can adjust to college as well as i have set my goals my roommates are out of the room right now , and i am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here they are both from lubbock also , and i have been friends with them for about 6 years my parents called today and it is very important to me to tell them how much i appreciate them paying for me to come down here i know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence , but me and them know it is for the best i am convinced that the business program at ut will set me up for a very successful life my hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously , and my eyes are starting to close i feel like falling asleep , but i know how much work i still have left to do for some reason , i get most of my work done around or after midnight it helps that i do not have a class until 10 on mwf and 12 on tth i am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church it is important to me to find a church in austin and not forget the ways from which i was raised many people believe ut is so liberal that every student comes out weird , but i believe there is something for everyone in austin i have already met so many people just like me , and it is awesome by far i can tell that college will be the best time of my life the only thing i wish i could change is the dorm food i am getting so tired of chicken every meal i do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically limits it to chicken well the saying goes , everything tastes like chicken anyways maybe next year i can get an apartment with some of the new people that i meet and possibly the guys from lubbock too i am trying to figure out why my email is not working it keeps making me re log in and it is really getting annoying oh well , two more days to the weekend arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game i saw some of the football players today wow , they are so huge they are like a different breed of people i want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big i know it is some sort of phenomenon or something i figured out that in 2 minutes i have to find something new to do so i am already brainstorming i wish every paper was this easy english papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind it could go on forever i never have to stop and think dell what an amazing company how does someone without a college education make so much money i hope my college education will lead me to success like that well , time is up

2003_353.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i really want to go take a nap but i ca not because i have so much work to do that 's how it 's been since rush started rush was when i really started feeling like my life was going through some changes that i did not know if i could handle now that 's it 's over and now that school is underway , the stress does not seem to be going anywhere i always heard that college would be super stressful but never realized that what people were referring too was not necessarily just the school work i thought i was so prepared to come to ut , and i guess based on my high school education i am , but i was not ready for trying to mix sorority and social life ( one in which they expect you to go out every night ) with school and my goal of a 4 0 now , for one of the first times , it feels like i'm not going to be able to reach my goal i am so worried about it i already know what i want to do with my life , and that just makes it more stressful , because i know what i need to do to get there oh well i do not know what to do about trey he is my boyfriend , or actually we are on a break because he wants me to feel no extra pressure of feeling like i owe him time while i figure out ut and while i get situated with everything i did not know someone could care about me the way he does and its so weird now because we always knew it would come to this and it just never seemed like it would matter i guess nobody really knows what to expect i spend more of my time helping other people and trying to make everyone in the world happy , that a lot of times i forget that my happiness is important too i guess that 's why me not feeling the need to make time for trey has been good for me it gives me less stress , but it feels like more is missing than just him in everything i do i put my everything into it so just knowing that i am missing opportunities to make him happy and even to make my parents happy by taking time to go have lunch with them , is tearing me up this week my goal is to try to squeeze in school work and stuff , but also i am going to go to every social thing this week i really want to make sure i give this sorority thing time to show why everyone who is in it , is so in love with it my mom is real pushy about it and my brother i do not think anyone in my family realizes that my brother and i are two different people i am not a partier , but we will see i guess i just really want to get good grades so i can choose where i want to go to medical school my brother had to go to law school in lubbock because he did not get in to ut 's he was upset i want to dictate my own future and where i want to go i just took that pretesting survey a few minutes ago and i thought it was interesting the variety of questions they asked i have a huge fear that someone is in the backseat of my car all the time well , only at night , like when i get in it after i have been inside or at someone else 's house i guess it 's better safe than sorry , but it gets old i do not know if that fear was there before i heard about my mom or if it just got worse after it my mom has been through some stuff that i ca not even imagine , and that i did not find out about until this year that would be weird , determining when your kids are old enough to tell them about certain things like her mom my mom 's mom was my favorite person in the world she was always smiling and happy and genuinely kind to and interested in everyone around her , especially strangers i found out also recently that she went through a long depression spell and when my mom was younger got electroshock therapy that changed her life it hurt me when i found out about that because it seemed that i was in love with a different woman because it supposedly changed her personality dramatically i do not really even know much about it i really hope trey finds something he loves in this world i really wish i knew how to motivate him he told me the other night that he feels like a loser around mje sometimes , even though he is not at all he is taking classes at acc , where there is not much school involvement or much room or making new friends i'm at ut taking 16 hours , with goals and ambitions and a new social life and a new school to be excited about i really ca not imagine us not staying together but we have been through so much and it really seems like we are perfect for one another , it has since the first day i get really sick of people saying i'm too young to know maybe i am , but i am a strong believer in finding things out for myself i always have been i miss high school sports a lot that 's where i got a lot of my self esteem from those underclassmen and everyone looked up to me so much i know that i am changing here , even though it has not really been new for very long , and i just hope i remember who i was when all this is said and done i like myself and i do not ' ever want to be just a person in the masses i do not think i'm doing this free write right i do not think its supposed to be as much about my personal life i just really have a lot on my mind , and i guess everyone else does too i have to go eat dinner before i go get dressed for tonight so i'm glad the time is almost up it almost feels better just to write everything down i used to do that a lot write out my thoughts whenever i was stressed or upset now i'm so stressed i do not even have time to do that car rides are just about the only time i have to myself or when i'm working out that 's always nice , until it ends and i have to go to class all sweaty i feel sorry for the people that have to sit by me after that !
2003_357.txt 1 0 1 0 1 wow , that clock starts right off the bat i always get nervous when things are timed , even if they are not important dangerous liaison i like that jason mraz song , its really fun and catchy the stations here play really different music on the the same station , when they say mix , they really mean it they do not mix things up like that on houston stations they should its really fun to hear all this stuff without having to get up and change the station i'm tired going to the gym really wears me out ooo fastball , i love this song , its so old , but i forget the name of the song i need to start remembering to bring change to the gym so i can get a locker there , hold all my stuff really gets annoying especially when you are riding the bike or something and there 's no place to put your cd player and your keys and the screen on the bike keeps demanding for you to steady hands on sensors in order to read your heart rate sometimes you just do not care what your heart rate is because you are tired of holding your hands in the same position for 20 minutes , but if you dare to take your hands off it flashes that message and sometimes beeps at you threatening to end your turn and start the time all over again i really hate those dang sensors yeah , i know they are habitual to stare at while your working out , but they really frustrate me yesterday , the reading was wrong , saying my heart rate was only 100 , that is not even my heart rate when i first get on the thing i was tempted to go get on another machine but i had waited in line forever for that machine , so i just tried not to let it bother me the whole time i was on it but i guess it did because i'm still thinking about it today commercial , commercial , commercial , i do not care about the sale at stein mart i do not like that store , they play elevator music in there i felt bad for my friends who worked there , having to listen to that while they worked , plus they said the pay was not that great but i guess you get used to it , they plated easy listening at the steakhouse i used to work at , by the end of the night , i was singing along with all the songs while rolling silverware you would be oh so happy whenever christmas rolled around and they played something different , plus i just love christmas music , its so happy and light i could sing jingle bells any time , its great ! that and that sleigh bell song , i ca not remember its name though
2003_361.txt 1 0 1 0 0 i do not know what to feel or think i am so overwhelmed with everything i have felt this way for the past two weeks , but it just seems like it is all crashing today i think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow i feel like i have so much to do before we leave i have so much homework everyday , and so much with my sorority , and i just want to have time to hang out and take it all in not saying that i never have time , because i do , but not much anyway , today we signed for our apartment next year its so crazy that you have to do that this early here but i am so excited about it i'm living with my roommate , my suitemate , one of my pledge sisters , and both of her suitemates it 's going to be so awesome so i had to pay that money today and in a couple of days , we have to pay like 600 dollars again , so that is a little crazy i ca not wait until i get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right like i'm having a blast and everything , but i feel so busy i missed my first class today because i was so behind on reading in another class i'm hoping i can control myself with that and not miss too often i feel so behind in most of my classes three of my classes have been all reading , and that is so hard for me i'm such a slow reader i just need a weekend where i do nothing but homework and study , but i wo not ever have that , because there 's football here , and i like to have fun on the weekends so , i love my sorority they are all the sweetest group of girls we have such an awesome pledge class i'm living with one of my pledge sisters who i have become pretty close to her i love her she is awesome we had our pledge retreat last weekend , and i got to know so many more of the girls i ca not say too many good things about all of them and i love the actives , too the seniors have been so sweet to us our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever i love going there and feeling so loved by everyone , it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place anyone of them would do anything for us , and that makes me feel so good , and safe did i mention that i feel like i'm doing homework nonstop haha i really need to read tonight , i have to stay ahead or rather get ahead that is the one thing that i heard over and over again from college students stay ahead on your work i need to try harder to do that , because in high school i was such a procrastinator and i ca not be like that here i really need to do good , but does not everybody especially since i want to get into the ppa program my problem is , i can study when no one 's here , and when everyone on my hall is sleeping or in class , but when they are all home , i love talking and goofing off with them me and my suitemate love to dance so we always make up dances in front of the mirrors i know , we are dorks , but we have fun our hall in my dorm is so awesome its crazy how close we got in such a short amount of time i feel so lucky even people on other floors in my dorm notice it , there like , i wish i was on your floor yall are so close and we are always like , yeah we know haha but oh well so me and courtney are going home tomorrow ! i'm so excited i want to see everyone so bad i'm really excited to see my sister and my dog i'm excited to see everyone , but i saw my mom and dad and one of my sisters last weekend at the football game i have not seen my oldest sister since i moved down here she is pregnant and due in october i am so incredibly excited its crazy i say crazy a lot , but maybe because that is what my life is right now and i ca not wait to see my dog , ellie , either i love her so much , and miss her so much she is a dalmation and 10 years old and so cute and lazy and just likes to be pet she is my favorite i need to decide what i want my mom to cook for dinner tomorrow night i am so ready for a home cooked meal i wish i was staying a little longer we are leaving tomorrow afternoon at like 1230 , and then we are coming home on friday after the homecoming pep rally we are going to , because there 's a football game here at 11 on saturday and i'm not missing a football game here i love college football , and i love texas football it is so much fun i have to go stand in line for ou tickets in the morning i think i got a pretty good number , from what i here , so how awesome would that be if i got tickets my freshman year that 's going to be one crazy game , and its going to be so cool to get to go and actually be a part of the school its going to be totally different than watching in still in high school my birthday is in 2 weeks i ca not wait i'm going home that weekend so that will be really fun i love birthdays i'm so anxious for my sister to have her baby , its due in like 4 weeks , so you never know she may have it early or she may have it late her name is abby and she is going to be the cutest thing ever i ca not wait to be an aunt i hope she has chubby cheeks i'm so excited yay !
2003_362.txt 1 0 1 0 1 today i felt very happy this morning at church i felt more comfortable becuase it was more traditional to me i guess after my youth back at my hometown that 's all i like my stomach hurts a little right now , as much as i eat i do not know why i keep losing weight last night was our date with martha and zra , it did not go as planned , at least for me i do not know what the deal is , but my luck with women is just not the best man , those little granola bars are the best , the one i ate with my salad today i'm thinking about talking to that girl in the cafeteria she is 22 i think , but then again , age is only a number in college in college it does not feel like i'm classified anymore , it 's just that i'm an adult now since i have been here , i miss my family , but i have not gotten homesick traffic here is horrible , it 's to fast i want to see that new movie freddy v s jason i do not know why but i read that this girl was not into scary movies it 's dark outside , i think i'm going to go run after this well the titans v s raiders game is on i went to ernie 's house yesterday to go watch all the football games that went on for college hopefully i do not get challenged for beating robby and ernie at ncaa that referee has an anoying voice i ate a cookies and cream ice cream bar , it was pretty good my roommate is laying down i do not know why it seems he does not have as much school work as i do i type pretty fast for a guy i really need to get that program for my computer with power point and all right now i'm looking at a picture of my family and pet 's i think i have to have the best parent 's ever , i mean , if it were not for them i would not be here right now i kind of want to here some ron isley this guy said he french kiss a french woman kinda funny this weekend we went to spiro 's , met up with stephen , could not get a wristband my printer is so slow , it 's loud also my fingers are kind of cramping and i still have 10 minutes left there is a little running icon on the left of my screen the sky looks awesome right now , it 's like the sun just passed the horizon i got back in at 5 a m last night i was pretty tired , i ate a pop tart before i went to bed i do not know why , but i knew i should not have ate but i was hungry i always think to myself if you just sleep through it , you wo not be hungry i talked to brittany today , she is pretty hot i think she has a boyfriend back in her hometown speaking of which , why is everyone going back home they just got here i know if i went to tech i would not be going home all the time i keep hearing a little bit of words from the tv and it said the crowd is loud and another flag down stickie note says , aug 29 fig meeting our fig supervisor is pretty hot also she is a sophomore , so maybe i could talk to her too next week we play arkansas i remember one time at tech during my athletic training for nca , i thought i was in a tornado rosalinda was eating pizza that night a bright neon light i hope that this test does not say that i think about food to much , i have said something about food like 6 times i used to be a big guy , 280 lbs now i'm down to 210 i feel better , just not sculpted i'm kinda nervous to go to greogory gym to go join a rec sport i'm not sure how it works and i do not have the money to just throw up in the air hey , i just looked away from the computer for once right now as i type i'm looking at all the wires on the floor that could start a fire nah , the papers are not close enough that did not make sense i have this candle from initiation the other night i kept it because i like keeping sentimental i also collect coca cola bottles i gave up cokes like a year ago i think this whole year i might of had 10 cokes all together that 's healthy especially here , all you can do is sweat here , i hate it the trash can is fully , i threw it yesterday but i forgot to put a bag in it i hear someone passing outside you know , sometimes i drift away from my mind set when i drive it 's like i do not remember how i was driving from point a to point b it 's kind of hard to explain it usually happens when i have a millions things running through my head internet globe that recycling commercial keeps coming on that bad ass station 93 3 love my mom loves me , she wants to send me money for my birthday next week wow , the big 19 i'm getting old , only 2 more years and all will be good something i have waited for in awhile my grandparent 's god bless their souls i miss them so much love you grandma and grandpa !
2003_363.txt 1 1 1 1 0 wow i really need to shower but i'm going to go work out later so that is ok maybe tim will come and abbey and mike , they would be so cute i do not know though but i'm glad tim called me yesterday the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should i put them , i guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs i wish i could use those but every time i go down for lunch you ca not get in from that staircase , its annoying i'm really hungry i was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but i mean i practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok , plus its the weekend soon and i do not want to waste it i forgot to go draw my tickets , i never know when to go i should look it up soon but i ca not go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their ids and its probably too late anyway and lets see only like an hour till psychology , i want to sleep but ate the candy so i would stay awake and its working i mean i'm a little tired but not too much i went to bed around like 1 last night but i wanted to study more , but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when i turn on the light , like its a spotlight on her or something anyway kinda pisses me off and i have to do everything in the dark which takes forever , i have to brush my teeth , take my pills , do my nose drops , lots of stuff and then she wakes up really early well she had a class , but she did not wake up to her alarm and i did and then when she left it went off again and i still had an hour to sleep before i had to get up to get dressed it was cool though my room is nice and clean now , the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday i ca not really do this if my roommate is in here , oh well she is about to come in , i hope i can focus ! this is really hard to think of things to say because i have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness i do not know if i will be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and i do not know what time it closes probably all sold out anyway , so many people here but its funny because i'm not meeting as many people as i would like to , but i have only gone to like one frat so i'm glad i met tim though , that was kind of random and he is really cute and abbey seems to like mike , who really likes her , and they would be cute too but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie , she goes to frats like 4 times a week , its crazy and i have been friends wither her for like 10 years so i know she procrastinates so i hope she gets her work done i do not think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something , whatever though we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble , its such a far walk i do not need coffee either but i think abbey thinks i'm mad at her so i'm going to go anyway and just study i guess i mean i knew college was a lot of studying but i did not think it would be this much maybe because i'm such a slow reader i only read about 20 pages per hour and in the textbook its only 10 per hour its so slow and so many pages i finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago , it was sort of interesting but i hope the next chapters are better i do not think i'm retaining anything which is bad because i read for so long that you would think i would be learning it i get psychology confused with philosophy and then ca not seem to remember either of them but in class i listen and i get it , then after i try to think about it and all my classes run together yesterday was especially bad because i got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment i made a 71 and it really pissed me off because i worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and i trusted it he also did not do some examples on the board correctly , which made me get another one wrong today he was all oops yeah it made me mad but oh well i can drop it according to the syllabus that i do not have printed out i hope whoever reads this does not think i'm a psycho or anything , or ca not spell because its either a typo or i just do not spell well i really am a good student though and i'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and i have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off , and it sucked i was in the bathroom at kerby lane and i cried when i told my dad , i always do that its good that i have bangs now because if i were to cry or not pluck which i need to do , you ca not tell that much i'm funny about crying , i do it when something really touches my heart , which is kind of often i guess but pain wise i'm pretty tough , i played basketball for so long i'm so accident or injury prone i swear i always get hurt at the football game that hurt so much when i stepped on that glass i think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not it does not hurt anymore so that is alright i just hope everything goes well for me i mean i really wanted a 4 0 gpa but now i'm scared maybe being scared will hinder my performance , so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that i'm smart enough twenty minutes is almost up

2003_365.txt 0 0 1 1 1 well i have finally sat down to start writing this and i'm wondering where its going to go i do not feel like i have a whole lot to say though i'm sure i will end up babbling for the next 20 minutes its rather cold in here i turned on the air conditioning because it was hot and now its a little too cold i'm borderline shivering i suppose that is preferable to sweating constantly though as i expected texas to be feeling pretty hungry as well i have not eaten since about 9am i meant to go get some dinner at kinsolving around 6pm but lost track of time and now they are closed its really annoying how they close so early even if i were to go eat at 7pm i would end up hungry again before i go to bed and eating microwavable dinners does not prove particularly satisfying or healthy this laptop keyboard is being a real pain as i try to type this i'm not used to it at all because i just got this computer yesterday my poor typing could also be due to the complete darkness in here , i suppose i should turn some lights on but its kinda nice keeping it cool and dark my roommate is at his engineering lab right now so its pretty quiet i'm a bit bored as it is the whole dorm itself is pretty quiet except for the two guys next to us who feel the need to play guitar and sing ( poorly i might add ) crappy punk songs judging by his volume and consistency i would venture a guess to say he actually thinks he is pretty good unfortunately for him , and all of us who have to endure his endless moaning he is quite the opposite oh well , i suppose that is part of dorm life as i thought i would i have found myself making use of suppose , although , and though a little too often i think that i think it makes my writing sound smarter or something when it in fact usually ends up diluting my points and making for some long sentences ( like this one ) i just realized i have yet to break this up into multiple paragraphs which makes it rather hard on the eyes there 's a paragraph break just for style points even though there are not any of those speaking of hurting eyes i'm wondering whether this laptop screen might hurt my eyes after awhile its at a rather high resolution but its still fairly clear i do not feel any eye strain so i'm hoping its a non factor unfortunately , the fancy ( but cheap ) office chair i bought is rather uncomfortable after long periods and i find myself leaning over the desk in a rather uncomfortable manner , both for my back and neck hopefully its something i will adjust too in retrospect that paragraph break was a good idea it makes this look much less like some random ramblings although it would be quite obvious that the contrary was true to anyone who was reading this ( you ) there i go with the 'although' again its really rather annoying my constant use of rather is also somewhat annoying for some reason i imagine someone with a british accent saying rather everytime i type it after i wrote those last few sentences i started thinking of pre testing and its questions that are meant to probe your inner soul which then of course prompted me to wonder how one ( you ) would analyze my constant annoyance with my own writing style what does this say about me i do not know , nor do i care although ( dammit ) i would once again venture a guess and say nothing boy time flies when you are babbling and rambling i was hoping for some synonym there but it would not come to me so i just let it go thank god i wo not be taking much in the way of english courses the next couple years writing weekly papers for the last four years has been tiresome to say the least i feel a headache coming on now probably from staring at the computer screen for the last 2 hours or so although ( i ca not stop myself ) i have sat in front of one far longer than that before with no ill effects i often wish i knew all the weird stuff that goes on in the body so i would know exactly what was happening when something started to ache or twitch or some such thing i recently found out that the twitching muscles in your leg can be caused by potassium deficiencies ( i think i butchered that but i ca not be bothered to figure out how to spell it ) it actually works out nicely that the only fruit consistently in kinsolving is bananas although ( its unbelievable really ) they have been a bit over ripe the last few times i went there well down to my last ninety seconds if you were or are hoping for something even remotely enlightening or insightful well you are just flat out of luck so i have managed to type random sentences here for the last twenty minutes and its worked out alright i did not type out the last two numbers because i did not want to look for them on the laptop keyboard and i'm done yay now for more homework
2003_366.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i ca not stop sniffling i do not even know if that 's how you spell it i'm so pissed off that i'm getting sick i guess that 's what happens when you live in a dorm i better not get some crazy disease though i probably wo not should i finish my homework or should i just pass out i would prefer to do that latter my bio 211 class sucks a lot of balls the professor i think is just trying to sound intimidating , and if that is the case , then she is doing a really good job at it man , i really really want to be a doctor i'm not as smart as everyone else things do not just come to me i have to work for it this may , in the end , work in my favor , being that if i ( and hopefully i will ) succeed , i will feel all the more complacent but that 's just wishful thinking i'm really going to stop with the caring about capitalization when i type emails i never capitalize my i 's well i just did but that 's different there was this guy i one knew that always made me feel stupid if i did not spell things right i know how to spell and i believe he knew i knew how to spell , but i think he took some kind of pleasure in my feelings of inferiority perhaps , i will always feel that way when i am around him well it has not stopped for about 5 years now who would have thought that we would end up at the same university i mean i know it 's not a big deal , being that ut is enormous and all , but he is not going to escape me i wish i want him to escape me but i do not that 's not good at all what a jerk i mean ok , well he is not really a jerk , but i always feel like he is messing with my mind maybe i'm just the one that 's screwed up i think i am i'm really glad i did not seem him today i needed a break from all that good break from it right here i am in my stream of consciousness talking about it i do not know if i spelled that c word write either but who the hell cares right wow i'm really glad it did not push finish on me there sometimes that happens that would have really sucked because i have already spent 8 min and 47sec typing this i kinda like typing it makes me feel pretty cool thank goodness i'm a fast typer if i was not , things like this would really suck ( i'm trying not to say 's uck balls' ) now i'm laughing i do not know where i got that expression from maybe it was my sister yes , yes , i have a twin sister ohhh ahhh a twin does she look like you are ya will identical blah blah yes yes and no the end if i spoke anymore about this and this is in some way published before the class , there would a better hint as to who the writer of this stream of consciousness is it 's alright not that i mind i miss my nephew he is the cutest thing in the world i miss when he would try to say bob the builder what a cutie ! he learned to say my boyfriend 's name before he learned to say my own name yeah i was a little upset at first , but it 's really no big deal i am glad he has a solid man figure in his life the boyfriend 's a good role model and he obviously loves my nephew very much oops just sneezed wow and sorry the phone 's ringing i ca not be mean and be like hey i'm typing this stream of consciousness thingy ok that 's over , and i just realized that the spelling of consciousness has been at the heading of this page the whole time i am a genius beautiful well i was spelling it right that 's good man , sometimes i start to think in spanish that 's cool is not it i kinda like that i wish i could speak fluently though it would make things a lot a lot easier i really do want to go to spain it 's on my list of things to do in my life , along with help others , become a pediatrician , and give back i love my major i'm so glad i chose it we had a great discussion today about poverty and things of that nature i am definitely a democrat but that does not mean i'm some liberal liberals get such a bad wrap it 's not true you know what else gets a bad wrap jester jester really is not that bad to me , when people complain about jester , they just sound really really spoiled i know that 's judgmental but oh well i love how it 's really social that 's how i met one of my really good friends here we were in our horrible community bath no it 's not really horrible and that 's how we met she is really cool , from out of state time 's almost up adios amigo
2003_368.txt 1 0 1 1 1 well , here i am doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due i do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as i do lack of sleep , maybe laziness , probably i consider myself a good student , but when it comes to doing papers or projects i always put it off until the last minute i just got home tonight , its past midnight , and i am tired i really want to go to sleep so i am not dead during classes tomorrow i am worried about how things are going to work out grade wise this is my first experience with a grading system such as college , with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades pretty much all my classes are going well , but i am not sure how i am going to study for exams however , i think that if i keep up my study habits that got me here , i will do just fine i am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and i do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep my eating habits worry me too now three solid meals a day used to do it for me , but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all i go for my head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out i really love music no matter how my day is going , there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits i enjoy all different kinds , and i have listen to a variety since i have started writing it is quite weird now that i think about it , but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out i have always been a calm , collected person but there is just something about it that i truly love the whole college experience has been great so far i love the campus , the professors , and the people most of my professors give great lectures , and class is actually enjoyable now i almost look forward to each new school day now that i'm at the university being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome , but there are times that i wish i was still back home in high school , not worrying about anything
2003_369.txt 1 0 0 1 0 i am sitting at my small desk , looking at my computer i am not sure what i should be writing about , so i just type my shoulders hurt and i am ready to go to bed but i have so much more to do before i leave tomorrow to go home i am excited about seeing rich i wonder what we will do i know i have to work a lot and i w2ill probably be tired when i am done , but i will probably still want to go out because all i do here is work , study , work out , and try to keep my life in order cleaning my root day was a pain in the ass , finding places for everything sucked , and i still am not done it will feel like a dark cloud over my head until everything is in place , which is likely to never occur my roommate passed out tonight while studying she works crazy hard and is so focused right now she keeps mumbling in her sleep it is pretty funny i hope i do not disturb her i do not know if she would want me to wake her up because she fell asleep in her clothes and stuff on her book i will probably just turn the lights off or something like that i am craving some ice cream right now i want vanilla frozen yogurt with granola mmmmm that will be my reward for getting this done early i am glad that i finished my astronomy assignment tonight it was just another thing that was hanging over my head i have all this damn reading to do and i ca not seem to get past any of it because the second i finish one chapter , there is another chapter due in that book and in my other classes plus studying for that menu test it should be fine though i always get more stressed than i need to over everything i like my laptop , but these keys piss me off i do not understand why certain things happen the cursor moves and it messes up what i am typing grrrrr i also want a diet coke i am having trouble understanding why people gain 15 lbs when they go to school i walk my ass off to and from classes i am so afraid that i am going to gain weight i did not have time to make it to the swimming pace today grrrrr and i have not done the firm today either i really should i need do but i woke up too damn late to do it i hope i get up at a good time tomorrow morning i wonder when rich is going to call i think when i finish this i am going to take a shower that will feel good , and rich will probably call super late , whenever fox 's closes i miss him i hope he is having fun , i wish i was 21 already it is such a pain in the ass i feel so much older this juv del class is totally opening up my eyes to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking and it is making me seriously doubt the stigma of underage drinking i know they have their reasons , young drinking affecting high school , and drinking and driving accidents and whatnot , but still how can i be treated as an adult in the court system , work place , and everything else , but still not be allowed to drink alcohol that does not make sense at all to me how can my friends be allowed to fight in war yet not drink beer that is silly and frustrating and now that i know how the laws came to be how they are , i am even more stupefied by it i love that class and teacher he teaches basically directly out of the book , so i just have to skim read it , and that is pretty awesome and his lecture is interesting , and he makes me laugh that is so important a sense of humor is everything i like my nut teacher too , but learning that stuff makes me fee guilty for eating if these damn pop ups do not stop soon , i am going to have a serious problem i am glad i am leaving again this weekend even though everyone says leaving is bad , i still have a great time at home and right now , i do not feel like i am missing out on anything here i am going to try to balance it well , but i love spending time with rich i love him , and i think he brings out the best in me he has such a great sense of humor and i laugh all the time when i am with him i laughed so much at dinner tonight with them and bryttne not at brytt so much , but em and i are so open
2003_373.txt 0 1 1 1 0 ok well here i am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment earlier today i had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid has not come through yet but now they said it should be getting here anytime soon and one more thing i still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week , they had said that it had been ordered although it was not there yet so i'm probably going to have to go later on today then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning i still do not have a sports package and i did not buy a ticket so this time i wo not be seeing the game i have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where i come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way i'm still unsure as to what exactly i will be saying i just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper oh man , yesterday some friends and i went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now we are probably going again today , but who knows i'm starting to get a little hungry now , i ate breakfast this morning but i'm getting hungry again oh i almost forgot , today is my friend 's birthday , i need to call him after i finish this assignment he is back at my hometown , el paso , but i'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday for some strange reason our room always gets real cold and then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they ca not move it unless we fill in some sort of request and then other people down the hall complain that it 's too hot in their room i do not know but whatever my board here in the room looks kinda plain right now i was initially going to put up some posters a while back , but i ended up doing other stuff and then i would get lazy , so till now the board still looks bare all i have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right and then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay all i need now is to actually get the other pictures i wanted to put up already oh and then there 's my calendar on the wall too , but that 's about it i'm definitely going to finish that this weekend last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and i just could not fall asleep soon enough i did though and then i had to wake up early because i have an eight o' clock class , but i managed to do it so now i'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and i need to get a book then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday while i will be sleeping in , she will be at the game she can later tell me how the game went , because last time it was raining , hopefully it wo not rain again now i'm a bit thirsty , i think i'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs ok that was all for my 20 minutes finished
2003_374.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i am thinking about why exactly i am writing this i am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys roseanne is on and it is starting to distract me i really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me the show is talking about feminism , which brings up an interesting point i really do not like women who are amazingly feministic i just forgot what my next thought was oh well , i feel kinda of hungry maybe i should get something to eat but instead i have this laptop sitting on me while i try to type my steam of consciousness speaking of stream of consciousness , which i spelled wrong above the stream of consciousness is something that i read in the textbook some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves roseanne just made a joke and it is funny but as i was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses before i digress , or maybe i will or maybe i wo not now that i choose to reflect on my day i realize that i did not get that much accomplished , but there is still a lot of the day left i am really not sure where i am going from here there was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah boy i sure do love hi i just answered my phone and it is kristi my friend she is also in psychology we are talking about this assignment she is walking back from the dobie center i am supposed to meet her and her friend richard i am going to play richard in football on the video game boy i really like football like i was saying i love football and i ca not wait till the game against arkansas boy that is sure going to be a good game i just happened to notice that i only have six minutes left to write i really like this assignment it is really fun my hands are getting tired of typing and i just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny i really do not like roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention i am really trying to concentrate on what i am thinking but i believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more , because i am thinking so hard my computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot but in here it is actually cool speaking of my dorm room , i really like it well my 20 minutes is up but i am just going to finish writing this last line right here
2003_375.txt 1 0 1 1 1 right now , i am thinking about my chemistry homework and test i am very nervous about it and i am worried that i may not succeed to my fullest potential i am also very nervous and anxious about doing this writing assignment because i have never done this before i'm also listening to music because it helps me to relax i am cold and sometimes in makes it difficult to concentrate because my attention is focused on my coldness i pretty much just look around the room every single day and it helps me to think things through i also think about the things i have done wrong in my life and how it is that i can go back and correct them there is this person i love so much with my entire heart , but i do not like him hanging around my best friend wait , its more like i do not like for her to hang around him yesterday , she just freaked me out because she just came up to us , my friends and i , and she just leaned on my boyfriend what kind of a friend is she to do that she knows that i hate for her to be around my boyfriend and every time she is around him i end up getting mad at him , when , in reality , i should be getting mad at her there are so many things i want to tell her , but i'm afraid i will end up hurting her , but i feel she needs to know that it does hurt me a lot when i see her flirting with my boyfriend she has always been boy crazy , its just that people do not know that every time she is around him i get this ugly feeling in my tummy like there is something very wrong and then today just out of nowhere i told her that she needed to find herself a man , a companion that she could spend time with and stay away from me and my boyfriend i know i should not say that , but its true i have always been very insecure about myself , but my boyfriend always tells me that i am beautiful and that he loves me very much i truly believe him and in my heart that we love each other its just my best friend somehow interferes i figure is she keeps on doing that i am going to let her know how i feel because i do not want to keep my feeling all bottled up inside of me first of all , i have never been able to deal with my feelings so i pretty much just kept them bottled up inside i do not know why i did that but i did , up until the time i started going out with my boyfriend he changed me and the way i felt about myself and i cherish that because he has made a huge impact in my life i love him so dearly anyways , enough about that i talked to my dad about an hour ago i call him every day , twice a day in fact i am what you call daddy 's little girl ! i am very proud to say that because i love my father very much he has done so much for me and i wish there was a way that i could give something back the thing is i used to be able to tell my dad everything , but then something changed i stopped telling certain things i guess he kind of saw me as something i was not and that made me very sad in fact , i'm getting teary eyed right now it 's like my father had this whole other image of the daughter he wanted i tried to tell him that i was different , but he just would not understand and now that i am over here at college its like , i wish i could take back every bad thing i did to him i want to tell him everything that has happened in my life , some good things and some bad i want him to know all the obstacles and temptations that i have encountered throughout the past few years i feel he needs to know what his daughter has gone through in her life a few days ago when i talked to him , i felt homesick when i hung up with him , i started crying i poured my heart out right in front of my boyfriend i told my boyfriend everything about how i wanted to have a better relationship with my father i want to let him know that i love him so much and that i appreciate him for everything he has done for me i also miss my mom because she has always done things for me and taught me different things she is special to me because of who she is i love her dearly i miss my little brother and older brother too i also miss my dog and my cat they are like my children they are growing up without their mommy and that makes me sad i want to be there for them i love my dad , mom , brothers and boyfriend i hope they know that they mean a lot to me and that i am lucky to have them as a part of my life
2003_376.txt 0 0 0 1 0 well , first i'm thinking that i should have done this a few days ago instead of on the last day there are still a few hours left , but it 's never good to procrastinate i guess it 's ok because i have been very busy lately doing work for other classes i'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 6th street and getting drunk , which is what i thought i was supposed to be doing some of my friends call me a hermit now because i'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times i do not really care i would rather be responsible i do go out though yesterday i went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game now i'm feeling full and satisfied because i just ate a pizza and i was extremely hungry i have not felt this satisfied in a while i do not really like most of the food in the cafeteria , but the pizza is good i miss the food at home i miss home a lot i miss my family even though i talk to them over the phone just about every day it 's just not the same when you are away life at home this summer was so simple i was just in my house very comfortable and without worries i would go out with my girlfriend every few days i miss her desperately i think i was supposed to also describe what i'm smelling i do not really smell anything right now i wish i could smell my girlfriend 's perfume again i think that 's my favorite smell of all it 's weird because i sometimes remember what the scent was i do not think that 's supposed to happen now i'm thinking that i have been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired oh well it 's in the name of science now i'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this i feel sorry for whoever has that job sorry for writing this much sorry for not being very interesting now i'm remembering that i missed the rain again i missed yesterday 's rain because i was in my psychology class when i got out , the ground was wet it happened again today on the count of my pre cal class now i'm thinking that i probably should have done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because i think there should be a timer above this box thingy now i do not know when to stop i'm probably going to stop too soon i will get an f in this assignment i will fail this class and be dropped then i wo not be considered a full time student because i'm only taking 12 hours i will be forced to go home , and i will go home a failure hmm that probably wo not happen after all , i have been having so much here , even though it is away from all that i hold dear i think i have 10 more minutes to go now i'm feeling that i have to go take a leak dammit it will have to wait i'm still not sure what this is for and what it studies maybe someone will read this and say that i'm crazy that would be funny all i need is confirmation now i'm thinking that my time would be better spent outside outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy a very pretty day i hate being inside i would much rather be outside i have a good view of the outside from my window i'm on the seventh floor so it 's pretty cool i think i'm doing this wrong i'm still not sure why i think my time is coming running out yup , i'm done
2003_377.txt 1 0 1 1 1 well i'm sitting here wondering why i have to do this assignment should i type correctly , capitalizing words i do not normally when i chat on i'm or email someone i really wonder if i'm ever going to get that song i'm practicing on the guitar it 's so hard to hear the parts because there are so many other instruments , namely the piano which is really getting in the way maybe i should try something simpler but i get so bored with the simple stuff i wonder if i can eventually get a jason mraz song or get to the point where i can just play something cool and everyone recognizes it will i ever lead worship at a church who knows i do not really think that 's my thing there are so many cool people that do that already in fact , i loved friday night worship at the sanchez building i really want to go back i do not know if hope in the city is the church that the lord wants me at , but i really like it i love how everyone is so friendly and genuine the worship is passionate , and i love that i walk in and go , this is how christians should be not like the majority of churches you walk into and see all the little cliques of friends , most of which are too comfortable and exclusive to open up to a new type of person or just a person in general however , i know that there are some really cool places in austin that i want to try the austin stone , hyde park baptist who knows oh , ev free oh , i saw court rode today man i love that girl i hate that it 's sometimes a struggle to talk to her though it 's cool if we talk about the general stuff , but not normal enough to just say whatever or something stupid because we have not spent much time together i mean , she is really cool , but she is a senior and has her own stuff , and i doubt that she would ever just want to hang out with me however , i should give myself some credit i mean , she has called me and invited me to places ( church , a cook out ) , so maybe she is interested in introducing me to some cool people cool people i'm finding some but still missing steph and allison back home man i love them , too they are great i miss being so comfortable with someone that you can just do or say whatever 's on your mind or if nothing , you do not have to say anything , and it 's totally fine i wonder how they are doing i wonder how allison is doing in the dorm , meeting new people , finding new good friends , like amanda i'm really excited that allison is branching out and exploring a m , but i'm not ready for loss of contact completely , and i do not think she is either i think she wants to ( as do i and as does stephanie ) make new friends but keep the old one is silver and the other gold i can deal with being silver , or bronze even , but i would like to keep a place in her life and man , i really want stephanie and i to stay the good friends that we have become this summer after leslie 's death i love how she always understood and felt the same way i felt we agreed that we never knew what al was thinking but that we wanted to leslie man i miss her so much silver taps at a m is tonight , and i really want to drive back i know i would miss spanish in the morning , but i just want to see my friends and talk about her and remember her i feel like things would be so different if she were still here stephanie and i would never have become as good of friends as we have because they would still be hanging out all the time they would still support and love me completely , of course , but i think i would be more like allison really branching out and finding new people plus , stephanie would have someone to chill with in college station sarah is cool and all , but she has her own issues , and i really would like someone there to keep stephanie accountable , to pay her the attention that she needs because we all do ! i would really like to find someone like me , but not too much , and without a boyfriend ( because the only cool girls i have found so far have boys long term boys , i think ) i really want someone ( a girl ) that i can just play around with be stupid and say stupid things , but also have fun and be silly i want to be able to plop down on her bed and either cry or laugh incredibly loud amazing , i actually already have that do i need want new friends other than camp friends like megan and meredith they love me so much and support me like crazy they like it when i'm around and like to spend time with me and hear about things with me especially meredith megan has got lots of other stuff that 's she is doing which is cool but she just does not really have all the time for me which i guess sounds kinda selfish now that i have typed it out but meredith truly loving and sincere and like a big sister just seeing her around campus encourages me and makes me feel at ease not that i'm so uncomfortable here i am so glad that i left college station and a m to come to austin and ut what a blessing ! this place is amazing and fun and new and exciting but also is quickly becoming a home i find myself either almost getting lost or just finding new places or directions or whatever to go around town , and i love it i love being able to know what street takes me somewhere else , or where my friends' houses are or where to go shop or whatever else friends' houses the boys have not talked to them , want to see them the girls looooved going over to their house the other night i got to chill with meg and tell her about school and life and etc while she shared the same liz and i also got to talk about spirits and applications and all that jazz oh and i made it to the second round of the texas spirits app ! exciting i ca not decide what i think about it though i know who i am , and i just want to be myself , but from what i hear and have seen , it might be like a sorority blah i just do not want to conform i want to be a part of something cool and unique but without being stereotyped as something i do not know cookie cutter , i guess i hate that i want people to like me for who i am stupid and crazy and silly and fun and smart and perfectionist that likes crazy things and crazy music crazy music acl ! and russ is coming into town , and i just do not know what i think about that do i like him does he like me i have no idea i do not think i would ever date him he is younger and in colle sta and whatnot but he is pretty great i just have no idea ok well honestly i ca not stop looking at the timer and how i have thirty seconds left so i hope that i was not graded on capitalization or anything because i'm sure that i messed up all over , but hey it 's all good all we had to do was write this thing i'm confident i'm happy class is cool do not want to take the tests
2003_379.txt 1 1 0 0 1 first of all i really need to use the restroom but i also need to finish this i have actually been thinking about this whoa look at that timer this experiment i do not really agree with because i am an awful typist and a perfectionist which makes this sort of painful i am going to use this time as uh um um time to meditate i needed to do this monday that psy webpage oh i listening to everything its amazing i keep on hearing my roommate peck at her computer my sense are keen at this time because i just am hearing everything this experiment is scary i do not think i would feel comfortable if thoughts of sex or murder came into my head i have trouble being blunt with god , how could i tell you who is you that sounds like some black talk with makes me think of linguistics i love linguistic kyle in my office was the first i think i should change his name peter in my office was the first to mention the stream of consciousness i was at a black poetry i got really mad because no one got there on time african american history the light on my charger is red no , it green this experiment is longing my thoughts while i think so i have in essence to streams of consciousness no i'm probably wrong i felt like am in a mirror and another one is behind me and what you see is another ending process my mind is so physical not in the sense of i like to look at hot boys but it just am getting tired of there is goes again that stupid delete i was scratching my head now my neck itches i guess this experiment is not so weird after all it is kind of like me i never feel like i am living my like i think its because i am so analytical that period and i an that an word i spelled wrong i am getting on my own nerves can i please just spell i am taking a breath when i'm not perfect i cause myself stress i got sad last year when i finally found out that i was not perfect i am looking into the computer as if i will remember that moment i sound like i am in a movie , so poetic , i am scrounding up my nose i have a snob nose some people think it is cute the question of beauty since i am doing this exercise for a minute i'm not going to care if i type right because i have to work on being perfect knoe one can be pertaect that is only a bplare for goreds hs is the perfect one i feel soreey okay the message just came back up i do not have to type so bad now my physically feels heavy why does feel and physically sound alike my my teeth taste salty i ate some how do you spell pretzels i think the imprint of the desk is in my arms i just scratched my head i wonder what kind of people go after the 30 minutes , nerds sick demented people i no that ca not be the case then i would fall into that category and i ca not have that even though i feel like a nerd people tell me i am pretty , but down inside i feel like a nerd this reminds me of that movie will anybody every read this e mail does it really even matter i want to go back to my movie but i am being pulled lead in another direction hopefully it is god i need god the time is 2 26 pero mi clock is fast a couple of minutes i quit in essence monday i would not just walk away i gave my boss notice that the weight of school and job are too much i really want to focus i my life with god life with god what does that mean i am ready to know god i am happy for the things he gives me pero i desire him more than the things i think that is maturity when children start to think what they can so for their parents instead of vice versus i this experiment has revealed in me my fear i leaving this world without an impact i not trying to confess fear just want to know i guess my life meant something i hope this class will bring my closer to god i just got to belief that what i feel is just more than chemicals in my brain i am ending it here though i am tempted to write a song though i have never written a some i have put down emily dickerson i have to read her poems she seems like a shady character what can i say of her character i did not or do not even know her ok ok goodbye

2003_396.txt 1 0 0 1 1 i do not understand how it is i'm supposed to write this thing when i ca not even type as fast as i can think it 's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller i have trouble with double letters in words for instance tomorrow is that right it 's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart i hate when people call me smart because i do not feel it it 's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really do not i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them they were so bluh i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad but never anything serious that involved me and my step mom lied to me about most of her life telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she ca not have kids then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me people never i'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me that 's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you have not talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes i think it 's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay last month i had to pay 117 on that stupid cell phone i did not even realize i had talked that much on the thing now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write can i cuss on this thing i do not want to sound dumb or uneducated ( which actually to some degree i'm not and early i did say i was not smart ) does that make me crazy i wonder if i can type stuff in another language say for instance people who 's first language is not english like my boyfriend i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i ca not speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it and i normally understand it too but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor i want to be a teacher too but i'm afraid because i'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework , but my pre cal i dread maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off i think i'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer i am developing absolutely horrid study , sleeping , and everything else habits here i do not even clean as often as i used to i just want to be lazy and go out i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict i never even got in trouble at school not that that is to be rewarded because you are supposed to behave in school and make good grades which i did but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes i'm not just exaggerating either my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did and he has explained why he kicked me out it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything sometimes life sucks big time but i'm not about to complain anymore because i'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes i want to keep writing but i'm supposed to do my pre cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i do not have

2003_403.txt 1 1 1 0 1 i really don't know or think that i have have any chance of finishing college i feel sometime that the only reason i am here is for my parents and family and the satisfaction that i will feel when they are all together at my house for my graduation party i personally feel that college is a old way of thinking i feel that one is brought up to believe that they have to follow a certain track in life all to often with the way that the economy is now and the way that job security is , i found it hard to believe in the belief that one should go to college get an education and go off into to work forbe and work there way up the coporate ladder a ladder that has been laid out by people who had the knowledge to know that in most cases college and the eduactional system is designed to train others to become productive workers for others i feel that the small amount of people who do become finacially secure at the level i someday wish to be understand that if you want to make more money then others you have to do things that are outside of the norm the reason everywhere you look you don't see tons millionaires is because only a handfull of people have the courage to step outside of the norm of society and do things thier own way this is the problem that brings me the most stress right now in my life i can't help but to think that maybe me thinkning this is a sign that i am meant to follow this path of breaking out of the norm but again i look inside of myself and wonder if i have the courage myself to do it i have tried numerous times to step out of this norm but find myself running back to the norm for security i wonder sometimes if this should this even be a factor in my life right now only being 21 but then i see people who i would like to be like and thier lifestyles and see that they have the things i want at my age and some cases even younger am i in fact wasting my life away sitting in a class room filled of 500 people whos ambitions in life might be to be nothing more then normal i myself can't stand to be in the norm i want to go my own way and do things that may be a little crazy or risky , but then again i guess that is why i'm writing this now a sad attempt to fill time until i have to courage to do my own thing man writing for this long hurts your hands i bet the beers will kill that pain why do i drin k everyday is it because i feel i have better sex after i have had a few drinks i know that is why i find myself doing that a lot why are women such a big part of my life is that the real reason i want to be rich and famous , so i can get any women i want what makes me think that i can't get those women know why do i feel ashamed when i talk to women now about my major and how i really don't have a high paying major i guess i could say i'm waiting to be a self made millionaire but how many people say that what is that smell damn my roommate stinks why is he so short , why does he have a severe case of little man symdrom i think his girlfriend wants me damn i sound like a nip tuck show guy that would be a cool job but to much school for plastic surgen i really need to stop dipping copenhagen i wonder if someone is going to read this if they do i wonder what they will think my attention span sucks i know i have add because i don't want to take the test , but ill take the medication why did i do so many damn drugs in high school high school man that was fun drinking before school xtc during school man we were a crazy crew i'm happy i still talk to like 70 percent of the ol boys and girls its cool having good friends , everyone should have a few i wonder if they look up to me for being able to drink the most is that why i do thaks for the time

2003_415.txt 1 0 0 0 1 okay so i was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed this was something that i really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and i seemed to have noticed a difference i first tried it out on reading a book i realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what i was reading , as well as , getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about when listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and i kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion i am listening to a dj named paul oakenfold who is a trance dj , and even as we speak i can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what i am writing yesterday , last night , actually i was doing some reading and i started to first listen to hip hop and i kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because i know a lot of them i ended up spending about 30 minutes and i got through about 12 or 13 pages which is incredibly slow after that i decide to try out some trance i actually used to always listen to trance last year when i would read or study because i always helped my expand my mind when i was either designing things , reading , or writing so when i was reading i noticed that i was much more attentive to what i was doing and got a lot more than 13 pages read in a 30 minute time period as of right now i am trying out this trance thing again the funny thing is , is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now the tv is on , my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework , and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book , and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies , not even paying attention to the tv but to the work that we need to get done after thinking about this right now i am at 9 min 30 sec and i have already written a lot i believe that if i would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that i am talking about class related things , how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling all over your body if you are just listing to music i mean does this feeling involve the way the sounds of the music are mixed together or is it the repetition of sounds and randomized pitches that might throw off your body 's response system that makes you feel all numb inside could this be another type of an anesthetic , but instead of a shot , gas , or gel , could it be because of all the sounds and beats like a hearing anesthetic who really knows but anyway that i am sure has been looked at for a long time i really am interested though in why trance music makes you feel this way because it really does have a positive effect on me but right now i really do not know what else i wamt to talk about because i am out of time
2003_420.txt 0 0 0 0 1 today is september 11th i was reading some articles on msn com about whether or not we should commemorate this i had a class at 9 30 i wish i did not have to wake up for this class it seems like whenever i have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy i'm glad that the only other class i have is in the afternoon today speaking of which i'm going home for the weekend that makes me happy because i will get away from everything related to ut austin my roommate was in the room , he just left i am writing on my laptop it 's very hard to use this keyboard i am tired right now i do not know what to do i have calculus homework to do i feel like it has been looming over my head i ca not wait to go to home i feel more comfortable here at ut now i think i'm getting along with everyone i do not feel stressed out anymore i feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about i will find what i like to do here i might join the badminton club that sounds like fun because i used to play badminton and now i do not anymore i do not play it anymore because i do not feel like it being at ut is a lot of walking , i'm tired cause of it i think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when i'm typing i am indian my parents are from india they are very nice people and they are at home sometimes i feel like they miss me and i miss them i am going back to see them i am getting tired of typing on the keyboard i think i am a smart person i wonder if other people think i try to act smart i do not really care if they do i'm just being myself i get along with others i do not think i will be completely satisfied in life thinking i have to be something when i grow up i should just stay happy as i am right now i think that would be a good life plan just take it easy that 's what i'm doing right now my computer is a dell and it 's a laptop with a small keyboard i got it new my roommate just came in he is doing the laundry i feel like he feels that he has a lot to do it seems to me he likes to work i am going to keep my life simple here at college i wo not expect myself to be a superhero i think waking up for class is good because then the day does not go by in college you have a lot of free time i think i spend too much time studying ineffectively i should set good goals and then spend time making friends i am very happy right now i feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up i have to get up to get the trash whenever i do work , i think of doing it in sequences sometimes i act smart it 's okay i like to make intellectual jokes a lot my parents used to take the trash from my room when i was young they did a lot of things for me now i have to do a lot of things on my own that 's okay we are almost out of milk i'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so i can just throw them away after using it i'm getting hungry my roommate is eating spaghetti from downstairs that tastes good am i being artificial am i talking as if i want people to hear what exactly i'm saying i do not now bye
2003_421.txt 1 1 0 0 1 i have been asked to do similar exercises in the past in which i was supposed to just write nonstop and track my thoughts or create a story , a cell phone is going off right now but it is not mine , i just got a brand new phone , it is a really cool camera phone , sometimes i hate having my cell phone because people just wo not stop calling me and it gets really irritating , especially if you do not want to speak to the person who keeps calling you i met this one girl amy , and she called me so many times but the problem was i was trying to avoid her because i was not' really interested in her but i did not want to hurt her feelings because i know there are times when i have felt lonely or hurt myself anyways i would rather too many people call me then nobody call me last year i did not have a cell phone and i was not really as socially active as much as people expected me to be or as much as my friends were i really hate the keyboard that i am typing on i am in the library right now , in the rlm building , i came here to come to a spanish class to see if i could get into a class i was not registered for i promised my mom i would come and check this class out because most of my classes right now are not to difficult and i have a lot of time something i am not really used to anyways my mom has been bugging me about taking a foreign language for some time now because she desperately wants me to learn something she owns a translation company and thinks it is vital that i be able to communicate at least in spanish if i am going to live in texas i really do agree with her but i do not really want to learn a foreign language i took french in high school and it was really tough but maybe that was because i did not really work hard my first two years of high school and i never really paid attention in class maybe i will be better now anyways before when i was asked to do similar assignments i never was really able to write anything down i remember one time i was asked to just write nonstop and then later what ever i wrote about i would use later for the topic of a story the problem is that i really was not able to write anything down at all usually when i write something i like to think long and hard about what i am writing about and then phrase whatever i am writing in a very articulate and cleaver way i am really hungry right now , i never ate breakfast i usually do not eat breakfast but i usually do not ' get up this late on the weekdays i had a rough night last night could not fall asleep and i did not wake up till 12 25 i had a class at one otherwise i might have slept later there are some people passing by me and i keep looking over wishing for some reason that i recognized them or that they went to my high school my eating pattern since i got to college has taken a weird pattern back to my no breakfast i have 14 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times i will only use 5 10 of my meals a week and that is being generous the first week i had 10 meals left , last week i had 6 or 7 meals left i am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me , he can use one of my tickets but he wo not come because 2 years ago he got kicked out of towers and i guess he is afraid of going back somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward 's way he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time he is by no means a bad person , he just does not like to be told what he can and ca not do if he does not agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else 's time schedule he use to be different , he use to be such a little goody good , he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp , i use to hate him when we were little and then other times i would love him but mostly i would hate him now i think he is one of my best friends i think that this is because ever since i have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me , he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel welcome and special , my parents will say the exact opposite about him , they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate they fight a lot and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they do not see things that i see i am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since i have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time my parents will say that this is his specialty relaxing and having a good time they think he is really lazy and ca not be bothered to ever move , but actually i have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task , since i have been in austin it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis , and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women this is not by chance well my 20 minutes already passed
2003_422.txt 0 1 0 0 1 sick nose running i feel like shit i think being sick makes me look ugly i hate when i feel ugly especially in psychology class where there are so many beautiful girls they are all so different amazing i have a lot of anger in me sleep deprivation is getting to me gentle breeze made by a rickety fan in my room ac is not working like it should 14 years old i'm thinking what a dance club would be like i want to play guitar when this is over i wonder if playing can compensate for the lack of female companionship i have tried , it all i think about blinds dirty lips a little dry eyes burning butt getting tired would it feel that way if you got laid wonder who came up with that word fight club i wonder if tupac shakur could have played tyler durden 's role , that is if edward norton 's character was black its friday and i do not have many things to do i think of what a date would be like sometimes i ca not believe how hard college dating is i mean is not this time about exploration so why do girls hold back so much i do not know , it very important to me for some reason i wonder if you look better when you are sick or just like that sickly this exercise is not free flowing as i thought it would be , i want to type continuously but ca not i have to pause and formulate my thoughts into words , sucks i have so many abstract thoughts not thought in words , see i was hoping to excel in this too because psychoanalysis was a career field i was into being good at this kind of exercise without practice would give me a flash of brilliance i hate looking out the window i feel like an old man depressed about life contemplating i have a strong sexual urge in me right now , i want to make love to a girl not sex i want to pride myself in the fact that i'm a rare college guy who can make love and not just have sex or get laid i think about when girls smiled at me or were attracted to me , does that necessarily mean there is sexual chemistry in my thoughts , yes but real sex is different from thoughts , too many details you forget when you think about it there are so many girls i want to get with at my 500 person psy class but i still have not and probably wo not i wonder how that affects me , especially on an unconscious level maybe it translates into a low self opinion because i think that every girl thinks i'm ugly how do i get over that negativity is there a way to feel good , even if you do not get girls can someone that does not have what someone else has , can they be as happy as that person my sexual thoughts are gone now , i'm still sick , about to sneeze , wow my thoughts are a lot more free flowing now , i have not stopped typing for about 5 minutes i think i see it now , i'm getting deeper into my unconscious or preconscious maybe i'm thinking of all the girls that walk by do they know , that if they snap their fingers , they can have any guy they wanted , what power makes me wonder how i should deal with them i think it would be very hard to get with them sexually because they all want something very specific i thought about listening to music while doing this , but for the first 3 minutes i have found that it limits your thoughts to the subject matter and emotion of the song i would rather get in touch with myself and hopefully have this analyzed and see what it means next thing i want to do is free word association although not sure what it is thoughts of mine still not as deep i thought , oh well

2003_431.txt 0 0 1 1 1 words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they ( ) but i like to use periods before , i was tempted to say , last night my ears met their lover too bad they did not have not i just wanted to use that nice quote i stole from an editor of epitonic i have an hour till i have to go to link but i really do not know about this whole christian organization on campus thing i need to find one that fits me ! oh thoughts and feelings sometimes i stare out at nothing in particular and it 's in those times that i am thinking about absolutely nothing oh i just got a call but i'm still typing ! darn you booksellers call back after nine thirty i wonder if typos make a difference because i do not like leaving them behind like that , so careless so , i need to get a haircut but how do i know which kind you know , some people just look good no matter what i think it 's a level of achievement that i will never reach oh well what if people were the same inside and outside like , for example , if all the pretty people were extremely good souls now that would make things different i ca not really imagine what it would be like , because i'm so busy thinking about what i should write next man , what should i pursue my stomach is really full i used to think that if i ever smoked , i could quit anytime , just because it seems so gross well i ca not even moderate my eating habits and i bash myself about it , but when hunger calls , i respond in full ! so yeah sometimes i fear for my safety when i'm walking around at night nothing ever bad has ever happened but i think i should still be careful but i do not think so enough since i'm going to do it tonight anyway i'm going to watch the goonies at the texas union theater theatre yeah hey i wonder if i'm going to make any good friends here at college it 's bad hanging out with old ones all the time , and believe me , sometimes i just do not want to excuse me i just sneezed what if i do really think in sentences i think i have a cold my nose is rubbed pretty raw ( well , not really ) from all the tissues i'm not thinking about anything actually , what i would like is to complete everything i need to get done soon i do not know how possible that might be but then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities , like reading and responding to other people 's e mails i'm so bad at that and so i could have time to read the bible and pray ah , i cannot control what i do , or at least i'm not trying hard enough it seems so easy to be a good christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the best of me oh i can wait you know , i do not want to think i'm invincible i want to make a difference and experience life fully the things i am most scared about now public speaking i just want to die when all eyes are on me the bigger the audience , the more humiliating you know , it 's not like i can control how i feel , to an extent at least i am also afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems unbearable , the time in the hospital spent recovering so many tubes i would cry out and i'm afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident it 's not so much the pain that bothers me , but the public scene it would cause how embarrassing oh well sometimes i do not care what other people think sometimes i wonder what they think of me when i'm shy , i tend to come across as being mean i have not really opened up to anyone before why should i if i do not trust them or if i'm not sure that they care about what i feel or think i think i'm good at observing people in their behaviors when i'm talking to someone , i can tell if they lose interest in what i'm saying at that very moment when they look away for a second i do not feel bad when that happens but it just makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect with me i know people need people and i need a tissue right now is this going to be read if it is , it 's okay i do not know if my thoughts are interesting , but it would be a fun thing to grade i feel like i'm spending less quality time when i'm reading out of my textbooks i want to go back , but then i just get this feeling of urgency even when i'm surfing the net imagine that what do i have to do anyway what 's the difference between an erection and an ejaculation i think i might know , but it does not matter so much to me i do not like it how professors can say whatever they want to say , like curse words and sex related and other inappropriate topics just because they can talk about it does not mean they should sheesh i also do not like how repeated exposure to talk i do not agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely , probably by the end of the semester here i am in college and i do not know everyone but a lot of them are making me less pure i do not think they realize what they are doing to the rest of us what rest of us , you ask i guess we are a minority then i wonder what i'm going to do for the final project in my freshman seminar either fencing , a christian organization on campus , if i ever find a good one ! or a concert although a concert might be kinda difficult since i'm not going to one until october 7th yay for beulah ! i'm so excited when i go to shows , i feel like i belong i do not know anyone there , but i like to observe them most of them have styles i wish i had a style i want to be like them or do i i want to be like me ! but , i need to be more like me then maybe if i had a lot more money i do have a lot of money what does being fashionable feel like not as great as i think , of course it just hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion we are the elite at least my mind can distinguish between the two but only street what do i make of myself then it 's easy not to care , but it 's not so easy to do that completely will that make people like me more is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself is that what we were meant to do the answer is no what if it 's different for me everyone dies alone , right donnie i think i need clothes to reach the next level of making me satisfied oh , if i had a different body no , no that 's alright then people who know you do not care it 's the people you are trying to impress who care ! hah i wonder if i ever hurt anyone 's eyes it pains me to think so before i left for college , at the goodbye dinner thrown for me by my uncle , the message in my fortune cookie ( or rather , one of them ) was be yourself and you will always be in fashion i suppose that 's valid ooh i can continue writing maybe for a bit longer i wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable i mean , come on , i already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music what good does it do there are always better , there are always worse but i wo not say any more about that you know , i ca not give all of myself away and to a stranger ! ( ok , i finished editing my paper ) do you think that this ( spilling out thoughts on paper ) is healthy for all of us not that it 's not , but compared to making no difference i think so

i'm just hungry do not mind me i actually talk to myself that 's great to know matt told me he thought i talked to myself , but i only do it when n someone is in the room because i know that person is listening my sister on the other hand , talks to herself in the shower , while getting ready , while doing something she does not realize it , i do not think and now she is a professor at a community college in san antonio , where my parents live i'm actually kind of scared of what i might write here today because now there is 8 minutes left ca not wait for this to be over over over yesterday i felt horrible it was just a bad day all together and i recently took that pretest thing that 301 requires it made me think of all this stuff i do not want to think about i wonder if i'm really crazy and the survey is going to tell me that like they would send me an e mail saying thank you for participating , and you are crazy go see a psychiatrist yeah that 's what they would do well they would not because everything is so damn professional now a days you have to sign consent forms and give up your unborn child and all that stuff i wonder if i'm being funny prof , if you are reading this , you must have a lot of time on your hands that guy that asked me if he could borrow my pen he had some thing on his head it looked like pantyhose tied at the back what is that what 's that for i do not even think that prevents you from getting hot or cold it 's one of those fashion things i obviously i do not understand yeah things are too strict now you ca not do things you used to and people feel safer but it 's just a lot of fear building up that 's going to explode one of these days how sad is that i hope i'm in another country when it all blows up i do not even think people realize it because not everyone is thinking that way they just live their lives and not care like people who do not vote i just think that kind of indifference is why the country is going to s yeah i'm not going to cuss here i bet you are having a good time with this , professor pennebaker ok now there is only 7 minutes left and counting whoohoo ! i ca not wait to go home i have done all this crap online today because my internet does not work at home on my computer it works on my roommate 's but not mind that 's just a bunch of crap that reminds me , i should get a netzero customer service number while i have the internet available i bet it 's dark outside what am i having for dinner sometimes i just have popcorn for dinner is not that sad i just do not have that much money to be spending here and there oooh but yesterday i did buy chik fil a for lunch that might have been a bad move because i was feeling nauseated after that it 's not good when you have to sit through an hour and 15 minute class yes that 's yours , professor ! i like your class though it 's so different from what i have taken here at ut and i have taken a lot , believe me ! i just think this whole pre health thing that i am doing is just me trying to prove something to myself ( first and foremost ) and to others i just want to know that i can do it i think the profession i want to go into , optometry , is a good profession i think i spend a lot of time slacking off sometimes i'm really down on myself and i'm very hard on myself i wish i were not like that but what are you going to do at least i'm not like i was last fall i was such a mess my survey will probably prove that it was a very dark time in my life yesterday part of that came back and that is why yesterday was not such a good day i cried like i used to cry last year and it was not like me i thought a lot of that aspect of healing was over , but i guess every once and awhile it comes back i just have this feeling that she is not gone and she is going to somehow come back into my life is this supposed to make me feel better well gosh darnet it 's working i usually do not say things like gosh darnet but today must be your lucky day , professor pennebaker i like that last name i bet you have a lot of fun with that i'm curious to hear what music is played tomorrow before class starts uh oh only one minute left better make the rest of this good mmmm chicken tenders that 's what i wanted last night but was too lazy to drive and get it i'm not that much a lazy person i worked out on sunday morning and am still sore from it that means i'm supposed to work out today only 10 seconds left i hope you have learned a lot from me prof because you wo not set
2003_444.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i'm hungry , but i do not have any of the food i normally eat if i had a car , i would go to the grocery store and buy myself some more myoplex ( protein shakes ) and some cereal and some milk , but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out of town football games and such , so they would not let me bring my car this semester if i had gone to school out of state , like both my brother and sister did before me , i would not be getting a car for the entire first year , but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was , and i have some scholarships on top of that , my parents are considering letting me bring my car to austin at semester i really do not know where there 's room to park a ford expedition in this town , but i will find some place my car would have been nice to have last last sunday morning , because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse , which is too far to walk to , and i ended up not being able to go because i could not find a ride i was pretty upset , but my r a danny , the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team , told me to go to practice this morning anyway , and the coaches would not mind he was right i just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that i was not able to attend , went through the workout , and they told me to come back on wednesday it was a lot tougher than i would have thought , in some respects , but a lot less strenuous in others , when i look back at it the one mile jog was not hard at all , and neither were the pull ups , but eventually the sit ups wore me out , and the jump squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets i think that 's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before , which was a bad move on my part , but it 's hard to say i have never done jump squats before , so i might have felt sick afterwards without being sore we did not get to go out on the water , which was somewhat disappointing , but the group of guys i was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday , while the other groups run body circuits , since that 's all our group was able to do we did actually take a boat down to the dock , and set it in the water , but i was not able to get in , and the boat never left the dock , so it was not as much fun as it could have been i'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session we get to use the rowing machines for the first time , and i have never used one before i'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze , or if i'm really going to throw up this time i work out 6 days a week , and i run , and most of my workouts are repetition , not heavy lifting , so i could definitely be in worse shape for rowing , but i'm still not sure how far away i am from the kind of endurance i need for the urgs ( rowing machines ) i would actually be stronger , but have less endurance if my shoulder had not been giving me problems all through high school i pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the new york airport after a two week cruise through southern europe we went to the doctor , they told me to lay off it , and i did , but apparently it was not long enough i was too anxious to get back in the gym , and i never let it heal completely , so about six months later i hurt it again six months after that , when it happened the third time , my parents took me to a doctor , and eventually to physical therapy the therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals , triceps , biceps , and deltoids apparently i had not trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body , which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements , where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder the doctor was amazed that both shoulders had not been more severely damaged , but i was told that i was not beyond repair a full month of therapy , very specific exercises , cross friction massages , and ice massages helped a lot , but my shoulder is still pretty fragile if i push myself too hard on the bench press , or if i do not put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout , it 's sore for the next few days i'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back , especially the scapular region , so i can push myself harder at the gym when i'm training the rest of my upper body the pull ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that i can feel had been neglected , because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull ups apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work , so i'm happy with the training so far i was actually worried for a while that i would not be able to train the rest of my body if i got serious rowing , but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps , so the rest of your body will need developing too , like your chest and triceps this means i can still go to the gym , and i actually have more reason now than ever , because i have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that i will undoubtedly be developing running and jump squats in training wo not come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout i want , but i'm not sure when i will be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day i suppose that after a few weeks of real practice , assuming i make the team , i will be able to decide when to work my legs , and how hard some of the guys there seemed to have been working out , or playing football in high school , because they were pretty used to running body circuits , and jogging , and were not too beat at the end of the day some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness a few people vomited , one guy passed out , and i heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing i'm not sure exactly what was going on there , but i'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet i ca not wait for it to get cold outside , so i can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse it was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator once it gets colder , i'm sure i will have to buy a sweatshirt , and some warmer gym shorts , but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse it will be a lot colder if i fall in the water too , but i'm hoping that wo not happen too often
2003_452.txt 1 1 0 0 0 what an odd assignment , write about anything for 20 minutes straight i really like ut but it is so huge , sometimes i wished i had stayed in college station my boyfriend and friends are still in college station , i was so close to houston and that is were my family resides its only a hour and a half drive but from austin its an extra 30 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving my brother is nearby in san marcos and that is only spitting distance from here while living at home this past summer i did not like it that much , now i really miss those crazy people i call my family there was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love i really need to start working out again because living in austin is making me chubby you would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking i have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow , i ca not wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow its our 6 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one i have known him for about 2 years now and its definitely better to be friends first my family loves him except for my crazy step dad , he is pretty weird guy anyways he is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money money really is the root of all evil , but you ca not live comfortably without it everything is so expensive now and days , the cost of gas is absolutely outrages what is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in american history so many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason , and it all happened instantly its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth its hard to imagine what i would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way its hard to think about without getting emotional i would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first , i would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy its pouring down rain right now , and i hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside i'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes , i definitely feel i'm paying my dues though and hopefully i can do something positive with this college education

2003_484.txt 1 0 1 0 0 basically right now i am feeling a little bit stressed out i have to go to this fiesta tonight for my sorority and i think it will be really fun , but we have to dress up i have no idea yet what i am going to wear on top of all of that i have class pretty much all day today my freshmen seminar is really interesting , but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries for some reason i am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school i do not know if i am behind or if i will be prepared for the tests or what i always thought that i would have so much more time in college because i would not be at school for 9 hours a day , but for some reason i never seem to have enough time and wow , right now i am really tired i wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so i could wake up early today and get some things done , but of course that did not happen i'm also pretty hungry so i need to decide on something to have for lunch we really need to go to the grocery store because we do not really have any good food i could go eat in the cafeteria , but for some reason i do not just love that food i mean it 's not really bad , but i just do not really like everything that they have downstairs i'm really glad that we have the kitchens in towers because i like being able to make my own food now i'm back to worrying about what i am going to wear tonight i should have thought about this a lot sooner i tried to go get something yesterday , but i could not find anything from now on i am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner my problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and i always have class in the afternoon oh well though ! i'm pretty excited about tonight , but i really just do not want to stay out too late and then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on friday so i think that should be really fun i'm excited to see her i have been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately , but i am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and i ca not wait ! now i am seriously getting so hungry as soon as i finish this i am going to make some lunch and i then i have to do some reading reading is really the only homework i have , but it is so time consuming and i feel like i always kind of put it off i do not know why i feel like that because i am not really behind in my reading or anything oh my , my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying , i guess i never turned it off i wonder if there is anyone here i know my roommate is at class , but i'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not it 's really quiet so i'm thinking maybe not i am definitely going to go get a coke and some lunch after i finish with this i am so tired , maybe the coke will wake me up a little bit goodness , i just wish i knew what i was going to wear tonight i think maybe i will call my sister later and see what she thinks i just do not know though my zeta bud never called me which is strange , but i ca not go to the activity today anyway because i have class oh well i think someone just walked in i wonder which one of my roommates is here i will have to go check on that and then i have a lot to do before my class at 2 i also need to find a map to where i am supposed to go for my seminar discussion today
2003_488.txt 0 1 1 0 0 it was a really humid day today while i was walking around on campus , but now since i'm at home looking out my window , i see so many people coming home from campus , getting off the bus with water bottles i realized that texas weather is crazy at one point it 's humid and then the next it is super hot it 's nice and clear now i'm sure its not that hot because it 's going to be 6 pretty soon and it cools down around this time earlier today i thought it was going to rain i really do not like walking around in the rain my first day of class at ut it rained and i did not know where i was going i was really miserable before you get home you get soaking wet and then the ac units are on all around campus so your freeze through your classes sometimes i wonder how the students at ut feel away from home i know that my first semester here i was extremely homesick i hated living away from home even though i was only 30 minutes away i lived in an apt my first year and i regret the fact that i did not live in a dorm because i would have gotten to meet so many more people that way but then again i liked living in an apartment because i had my own space i did not have to share a bathroom with anyone and it sure was not a crowded community with only two people in 1200 square feet area my freshman year i did not meet very many people , but my second year i was introduced to so many more people and i started enjoying college rather than just staying at home and reading or doing homework and watching tv there 's been a big change from then and now i actually like to stay in austin instead of going home on the weekends because i always have something to do at home i get bored very easily of course i still miss my parents but its so different here with all my friends all kinds of crazy actions go on college life it super busy this semester i feel is going to fly by before i know it i will be on thanksgiving break then studying for finals and then home again in two weeks after that sometimes i feel like i need to be more active in school programs and associations i never have time though something is always coming up i have a load of homework or a test coming up that stops me from attending these functions , or most of the time i am just way too tired to do anything for example , right now i wish i was lying in my bed taking a nap because i will probably have to hit the books as soon as i'm done with this writing assignment i never knew twenty minutes would take this long twenty minutes is a very long time as you can probably tell i am getting very restless i have very short patience i like to take care of my business and get going on to the next time can be very crucial sometimes when i'm late to class i wish i had more time to take are of all my stuff before i have to head out but other time when i have too much time on my hands i wish i had some chores to do or homework , despise the fact that homework can be a killer sometimes i do not like the way this apartment is never the right temperature it is always too cold or always too hot it is never the right temperature i think its because all of the rooms in this apartment are at different angles so they get cold and hot and different rates so my roommates and i always change the temperature on the thermostat according to how we each want it oh well i guess that 's the way it works i just looked at the timer and i have a minute or so left so now i'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts it 's nice to randomly talk about different stuff it 's unusual but good writing assignment kinda funny that i sat here and typed away for a good twenty minutes , and i just got stopped so i guess that 's it
2003_489.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i just started playing the smiths i kind of consciously did that because i wanted to see how that would make me feel while doing this assignment i think it would be pretty funny if i had put whilst on that last sentence instead of while anyways , i had to put it down now because i'm now conscious of the fact that i started listening to the smiths so i could say i was listening to them whilst typing this there i did it , i put whilst i also kinda put the smiths on here probably so that if someone reads this then they will know i listen to the smiths i do that a lot i specific music whenever people around , i do not know , i guess so they will think it 's cool or something i have been feeling really lonely recently i was thinking about that because i wonder if anyone is going to read this , and if they do , if all this stuff being collected is going to be used so we can learn something about ourselves i do not really want to hide anything , because i would rather someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me , than type jive like , oh i do not know what to write , blah blah , school was fun today , because i feel really fucked up recently i do not want things to change , this shit is so gay sorry , i know we are supposed to type thoughts but that 's still pretty bad i was happy this summer with a girlfriend and my friends around , but then we had to break up because she went away for college , and i freaked out on her which was not cool , but i was just really scared yes , this song is awesome i should probably go to the mental health center , but i'm scared of the process of signing up for an appointment , probably more than actually telling someone something , because then i have to talk to real people and i'm not so good at that that 's why i'm really lonely lately , i do not know how to talk to people , and i'm meeting all these new people , and i have no idea what to say , so i just do not say anything i would kind of really like to meet some new people , because i hate sitting around my room all the time , even though that 's all i do i'm scared to like walk up and talk to someone though it 's quite a frightening experience , and i get all nervous when i'm around people this typing is really hurting my shoulder because i'm on my laptop shit , i just hit the back button alright , i'm going to keep typing , but this is really gay , now i got to tack on another 10 minutes whoever reads this is probably going to be pissed that they have to read a 1 3 more than everyone else well , i better not get in trouble for it is all i can say speaking of gay , i called my girlfriend , i guess ex girlfriend , because i want to keep in touch with her , and she told me about how she saw this guy with a dashboard confessional sticker and a smiths sticker on his backpack , and she told me about how she and her new friend went up to him and asked him if he actually listened to good music or not , it being assumed that dashboard confession is pretty crappy , ( and who 's to blame that assumption , with lyrics like , far away from all the stupid questions 'hey , did you get some' man that is so dumb ) nonetheless , what the hell is she talking about , she did not even know who the smiths were until like a month ago when i told her about them , and i mean , i still think it 's funny , but a lot of the music she is into now is from me i do not know , i think i am just pissed off because she wanted to break up but , it 's perfectly reasonable , we are completely across the country , i'm being ridiculous i know , it just ended so fast , and i'm still upset ahh , this is not fair , i still have 13 minutes left because i hit back somehow , this is going to take forever my shoulder is kind of starting to hurt , i think this is a really cool assignment , because it 's just stream of consciousness , but it 's taking forever , agamemnon that 's what i say when i'm saying aggh , or something , because it sounds cooler i ca not stop thinking about my girlfriend i really think i have some sort of problem with dependence , i feel like i have to be around people most of the time or i start to feel sort of depressed , like no one cares about me this being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment , is making things worse my history of the banjo teacher , that 's a freshman seminar , told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo , and it 's driving me crazy , because i hate semi long nails , they always feel dirty , and i can feel them now whilst i type , clacking against the keys , it 's irritating i think there 's something wrong with my smell , i do not think i can smell anything that would not be surprising anyways , i think there 's something wrong with everything about me and everything i do i always seem to fail at anything i try , i can get good grades , but i have been missing assignments in college already , which is just compounding things and making things worse aggh , or i mean agamemnon i keep looking at this scratch on my arm , where i cut myself with a razor i do not think i will do that again , i was feeling really depressed on saturday , i did not eat anything all weekend , and i normally regimen my meals very carefully , but i did not eat anything , and feeling depressed and having read about self injury , i wanted to try it , but cutting myself with a razor did not feel particularly painful or punishing , and hardly seemed worth the effort involved , considering you have to clean up the blood , so i do not think i will bother with that again i ca not even do that right i have actually been feeling better the rest of this week , but i kinda want to talk to someone , just because i do not think there 's any guarantee i wo not feel like i did on saturday again , and i felt terrible saturday morning that was until i did dxm , which of course made me realize that things will eventually work themselves out i just wish i could manage to carry that feeling over into the real world , because not worrying about things is such a beautiful feeling i think i worry too much , but i'm always sure that as soon as i get by myself no one 's going to ever want to see me again and i will be stuck like that i wish i could meet some people here , but i do not know what to say it 's hard to just talk to someone , it 's always boring conversation , and at the end , they always go their own way , and never want to do something with you again no matter how good you try to make the conversation , they never seem to want to continue after that , despite reading constantly that the way to make friends is to simply talk to someone bullshit
2003_491.txt 1 1 1 1 0 this is my first year here at the university of texas and i am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations it is so hard for me because i have had to learn how to get around in such a large town , on such a huge campus , and living on my own for the first time is crazy i have to find a job because i need to be able to pay my bills and i still have so much school work that i have to keep up with at the junior college i attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to here everything is done over the computer which i guess is good since we are in the electronic age , but i just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face i miss my family , especially my sister i moved here by myself and i really do not know anybody here in austin i have never had to do so much walking in my life ! i guess i should get all the exercise that i need walking back and forth to my classes i'm worried that i wo not be able to keep up in classes i think i'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and i'm still very overwhelmed by all of it i just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things twenty minutes is a long time to write i never thought i would feel pressured to think i guess my thoughts do not come that often or just do not continue for twenty minutes straight i still have ten more minutes to write i wonder how these will be graded i have so much to do today i need to wash clothes , go to the grocery store , i have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend , and i have a test i have to start studying for i hope the test wo not be too difficult i always worry about the first tests in a class they pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester if you do really bad , then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester , if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester i wish that all teachers would do a review reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because i end up going over it again and again i guess its really repetition that makes me learn man , i still have five more minutes to write i have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class i was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class i bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size there must be so many distractions for the professor because i know i get distracted just sitting there in an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes , sometimes your focus drifts away i think that i'm going to like this class it seems like it will be interesting and fun i think that if every class was interesting and fun , then the college would be full of 4 0 students walking down the street my finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least
2003_492.txt 1 0 0 0 1 man these computer labs on campus are so sad , everybody seems dead i guess its probably because its sunday i feel tired too wish i could go to sleep i guess i would if i did not have all this work to do ca not believe its already 2 weeks into school it still feels like summer well i guess before i know it its going to be finals man i need to call nathan and get that hw of him wow that girl is pretty hot she probably is not that hot but i guess being in the engineering school you got to accept what you can get man i wish i did not do engineering ca not believe its been 4 years i really hate it but i guess it will get me a job i guess that is why i did engineering i wish i had done architecture i ca not draw but still its seems so much more fun i used to suck at drawing in high school i guess its a talent man i wish those two girls would shut up they have been liking whispering for 20 minutes i hate people who whisper i rather them just talk loud , even though its lab its very irritating thank god she left man i ca not believe dallas lost that game they played so damn carp so much for paying bill parcells 17million bucks they are never going to win if they do not get a new qb carter sucks , its been like 3yrs they should realize he ca not play well screw it i so want to be done with school , i ca not believe these freshman classes they all look like a bunch of kids , they seem so damn enthusiastic and happy to be in school it will be funny to see them in 4 years and see what they think then that girl in government class , i have never seen somebody so happy to be taking a class i wonder if i was like this when is was freshman i guess i was excited to be in college always wanting to party and stuff but i do not know if i was as crazy as sara 's sister she is well on her way to the freshman 15 crazy girl but i do not think i partied as much , maybe i did i feel old i really need to get out of austin getting tired of this town
2003_493.txt 1 0 0 0 0 my window is just above my bed i ca not see the stars but the lights of the city substitute nicely i wish my bed were higher so i could lay in it and look out the window over the city this is the one place that i feel on top of the world even though lately my world has been crumbling down i see the cars going by , some steadily others as though they were racing and the last remind me of my drum major in high school who used to yell at us for lollygagging i imagine they are going to exciting places places where they do not worry if their boyfriend is cheating on them or why they ca not seem to motivate themselves to do the assigned readings for class i pretend for them i make them my social group i have named the girl who sits on the wall outside dobie lisa i think its a nice name she is always out there to smoke cigarettes , i imagine because her roommate is the type that is anal and ca not stand to have the rules bent much less broken lisa hates that that is why she wears shorts 2 sizes to small that make her legs dimple while she is perched atop the wall i am lonely when i look out my window i feel like everyone else is too we are a disjointed people connected by this city , these lights and sounds that are the stuff of civilization i'm sure someone else is in that blue building with the step like structure sitting somewhere looking out , feeling the same as me i like it when it rains , when the sky is heavy and dark and sad i wish it would rain here i have never seen that from my window i think that i might like to live in a tall building like this later on in life , but i would have to live there alone its hard to bask in my emotions while my roommate debates who loves who more with her feminine boyfriend before they discuss what they are going to do for their umpteenth month anniversary my suitemate fits me better i feel how she acts , but i ca not express myself that way for too many reasons one very big one being my excessively religious parents they would flip no one understands my thoughts i care so much more about the whys than the what is , but i act the opposite i wish i could do nothing but read all day i would go in the living room in the pappazan or however you spell it chair by the window in there but it would have to be higher too to see out the window that is what connects me , keeps me here , keeps me from floating away so i would sit there and i would read i would go all sorts of places and be all sorts of people but my window would be my anchor as i sailed through these many parallel universes i think my favorite would be in a jane austen novel they are so warm there 's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think i wish i did not think i try to keep myself so busy that i do not , but my mind wo not be constrained its only controlled by the window , my looking glass sanctuary its solitude without loneliness i feel the most lonely with lots of people on the south mall at noon , walking to class so many people with such well put together lives , purposeful strides and slender hips i watch them i am behind a tree i wear long skirts to cover what i wish was not there , with my thick dark hair pulled back , tugging on my wrinkled shirt that wo not ever stay into place i am magic though , i have powers i can be invisible no one ever knows that i'm there no one ever knows i'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights i do not know about anything anymore i wish someone would just tell me what i'm supposed to do that there was some fated order of things that would be easy to accept , that is why we have religion it gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is but for some of us that wo not suffice no doctrine will halt the whys of my mind , i will always wonder about it if not the things it claims i'm confused and lonely and at my window it does not make sense but tomorrow i will get up and i will go to class i will say hi to all my friends and smile the weird thing is i will even enjoy it and be distracted so that i only focus on the what is i will watch tv and do homework , and probably even go to a club with the cute guy i ca not ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin ( yes there are so many problems ) but then i will go to bed i will lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain , and i will think about all the whys of my life and how i will probably never figure them out , just how to distract myself from them
2003_497.txt 1 0 1 1 0 i am thinking right now that this is kind of difficult i do not want everyone to know my personal thoughts i guess i have to do it anyway to make a good grade on this i need to get everything done so that i can go home i have to clean my room and do the psychology experiment , which takes a long long time i do not know what to expect from it either oh well , it 's required so i am going to do it i ca not wait to go home because when i do i get a snow cone that might sound juvenile to be happy about something like that , but there are a lot of people who like them i especially like pink lemonade with ice cream in the middle i think i might get that i always get it though i guess i do not like to try new things this is actually kind of fun my friend monica is in this class too are ya will going to take off for backspaces i do not even know if ya will can see when we erase stuff i am a fast typer , but i make a lot of mistakes that 's why i am saying that i erase my friend monica also made me a cd it 's really good it 's funny because it has songs on it that apply to my life well not necessarily my life , but a boy in my life i'm very confused about him i'm not saying that he is gay i just do not know what to do it seems that i have been thinking and talking about him all the time i e mailed him and everything i think that if you think about something too much it gets boring after awhile you just confused yourself even more what happened with him is that we liked each other , but i did not know what i wanted from our relationship and so i guess i got scared now i do not know what to do i always say that if it is meant to be it will be later god is the only one that knows the future that 's what i do not like i wish i just knew all the answers to everything man i just lost my train of thought that 's not cool anyway this writing assignment is pretty easy i think it helps to get things out we think a lot gahlee my grammar is bad oh well , it does not really matter let me think of something else to talk about hmmmmm , i guess i can talk about my room mate maybe tell stories not bad ones of course i will write down how we met i was really afraid that i would be shy at orientation since i was in high school high school was crap i was not made fun of and stuff i was just ready to get out of there i went to orientation and she was my roommate there because we are both in preview which is a group that takes summer school and they pay for everything except for 350 of it it actually helps you a lot you get 6 hours of credit for 350 and you make a lot of friends that 's actually where i met that guy monica and i got a long really well it seems that we are exactly alike that 's really cool she lives in san antonio well , she is from there she lives here ok so we met and i was pretty outgoing which is a good thing i have changed a lot i changed when i got here i think that is weird because usually it takes me a long time to get used to a place you get off track in these things easily i was just thinking a second ago about how i went to my pal teacher 's class and it threw me off i thought of it because i talked about how different it has been coming here my friend and i went to her class so that we could see her and she ended up making us talk about college i miss pals so much it was a lot of fun just really difficult sometimes it was kind of like preview in a way people could get in your business easily i ca not stand it when people do not mind their own business that 's funny because i am really nosey myself not in the sense that i like to learn everything about everyone 's personal lives just that i am curious about everything i really like this cd she did a good job daniel , monica 's b f is coming to visit her this withe i hope that ya will know what b f and withe mean monica really likes him i think he seems like a really sweet guy the guy that i like is sweet too i have not even said his name yet i guess i should but somethings need to remain private then again it 's not like ya will would know who he is awww friends are friends forever i love this song it 's so sweet man my time is almost up that 's not fun i like doing this i'm singing in my head i would type that out but it would take too long i wonder who else likes this song
2003_502.txt 1 0 1 0 1 here i sit in the jester computer lab , wishing that i did not have to be here why do not i have a computer , better yet , why do not i have a friend that will let me use their computers college is not like what i thought it would be it definitely is as hard as i thought it might be , school work wise , but i thought that the friends part would come easily i have spent 14 years of my life living overseas with americans it was a military base in asia the people in dodds schools systems are incomparable to the people in america they are open minded and excepting i was raised to believe that all man kind was this way i figured than when i got to college i would miss my old friends , but be glad to meet some more great people in this world but here i sit , in this lab , alone it 's not like what i expected , and worse than i ever thought i walk around alone , and although there are worse things , i use to be known for being loud and fun i was the person that everybody knew , and everybody liked i was somebody on my tiny base , and in my little high school of a hundred people but here , i am another face in the crowd of course i did not expect college to be just like turkey ( where my base was ) , but i did not expect to have no friends at all people have not even given me a chance here i'm just hoping that things get better they say that everybody has the same fears that i do , but then i see a ton of people hanging out with friends not everybody is in my boat , all of my friends are either across the atlantic ocean , or at least in another state i do not want to be a pessimist , and i definitely do not want to dwell on the bad , but it gets difficult when everything that i do everyday is a reminder that i am alone and here i sit in the computer room typing this thing , not because there is not a computer in my room , but because it is my room mate 's , and she wo not let me use it i let her use anything of mine , i do not even understand how people can actually be so stingy and be okay with themselves my friends have always come before my possessions , and people 's feelings have always come first , and i always know when somebody is feeling down , and i have always tried to help them i am waiting for that what goes around , comes around saying to come into action for me also , i had decided to be a teacher overseas for my life anyways , have my children grow up like me this has at least cemented my life goals for me my children are definitely growing up in a military school overseas the people there are very warm and accepting , and living among cultures makes everyone open minded i do not like the way that the people act here , and most of them do not even realize what they are missing in this world they just turn up their noses and avoid people who are different , and do not like any kind of changes i have been through two evacuations from my base , and i was just fine i think that i can probably handle a lot more than other people , and had they been stuck in a situation like mine , a new place with nobody that they know , they might be feeling just like me but i do know that i will get over this , and i will feel even more blessed to see my friends and live back overseas and i will be positive that i am doing the right thing when i give the life to my children that i had growing up i think that it shaped my character in a good way , and if anybody here were open minded and accepting enough to talk to me , maybe they would understand that as well anyways , i'm back , still here in this lab on this same computer i'm still here in this school with no body that i know people keep on coming in and out do they maybe feel like i do it is so weird to be standing in a crowd of more than 500 people , and not knowing anybody 's name but that is 500 people that i could get to know if they gave me the chance that thought use to make me happy , now i hate the idea i miss my old life but i wonder , if i feel like this , there has to be at least one other person that feels like me one other person who feels like they do not know anybody that thought does not make me happy , but optimistic that maybe i will be able to meet people sometime in the mean time , i am thankful for all of the true friendships that i made during my time spent else where , and i am glad that i at least have a loving family and friends to pick up the phone and call , no matter how far they may reside from me , i know that they care i no that no matter how alone i am on campus , i am not alone in the world , and every night i go to sleep thinking of my friends , and smiling and i know that in my four or five years here , i will at least make one friend maybe even tomorrow , so i'm just going to stop stressing about today , and pick up the phone and call a loved one for now
2003_504.txt 1 0 1 1 1 right now , i am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small i am waiting for a phone call that is so important , and if i do not get it , i am going to feel like a really big loser yes , i did just get all the blessings i could ever ask for , so i am selfish to be wanting more , but its something i really really want all i want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about i have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best , and i get so sick when i let myself down rejection sucks its so hot in here , and as all my friends call because they just got the call , i feel like a loser i am proud of myself but rejection is not something i handle well what if the call does not come will i cry , will i blame my inabilities on something else , how will i react the anxiety i feel right now is extreme on top of all that , i am homesick i have a great life here in austin , but since my family is a huge part of my life , i feel kind of left out being so far away everything back home seems to go on without me my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on she follows me around and sometimes i feel used because she really does not know people here she is not in a sorority and so sometimes i feel as if she is angry at me for that i am so anxious my boyfriend is supportive too , but i wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me yes , i know about his fear of commitment and all that crap , but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him oh , that stupid seventh heaven song turn off the dang tv all i want is peace and quiet without all the noise oh , and i have to worry about yesterday too my sorority is awesome , but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them yes , i know its silly if we all drink together but , sometimes i feel as if i have this image that i have to uphold and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life my family , my faith , my school , my friends how do i act how do i dress who do i associate myself with all of these things constantly flood my brain , and sometimes all i want to do is get far away from those thoughts do people love me for me do they love me for who i am here or the grades i make or the house i live in or the money my parents make how do people view me and that tv , always on what i would give for that chatter to stop for 10 minutes i ca not even study with the noise i am worried about this year i need a job , i have bills to pay , i am in hard classes how will i measure up i love my life , i love my life but i could seriously do without the stress i am determined , and i already have accomplished so much this semester , but will it end i want it to stay this way , but there is so much to lose i am scared that i will lose it how do i not lose it i pray all the time , and i count my blessings its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint why did i choose to live in an apartment with a girl i do not like what possessed me to do this did i feel independent and like a big girl now i feel young and naive , and way out of my league oh , the insanity , but good things come to those who wait and i put all my trust into a higher being so things will work out
2003_505.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i just woke up and i am feeling so drowsy i just went to a belly dancing show yesterday and i am thinking about how fun it was man that iranian guy at the club was so hot , i wish i could go up to him and talk to him , but i'm too scared i feel like i would be rejected in two seconds he did not even look at me , or did he that dirty old arab guy was freaky though , he kept asking me to dance with him and that made me really uncomfortable i am really really hungry , and the droning of the refrigerator is not making the situation any better i'm afraid to even open the refrigerator door because it smells so bad in there we really need baking soda i wonder if the chemistry test is going to be hard , i really hope i understand the difference between atoms and molecules and i do not completely blank out during the test this assignment is really cool , it 's helping me empty out everything in my head it is extremely cold in here and i want to go talk to that guy on the second floor he was such a nice person and i have not really met any iranians here i hope the iranians in the isaco club are nice and they are not like all those fake iranian girls that dye their hair blonde and all have nose jobs and live at the mall that reminds me of bahareh , she was such a rude , mean stupid girl she had no right in saying those things to me , and for some reason i ca not get over it i am thinking of erfon , i wonder what happened to him , he reminds me of kourosh , i hope he does not become afraid of me like kourosh did though i wonder why kourosh is acting like that i have not talked to him in a really long time , he should not be intimidated by me ! anyway my hand is beginning to hurt and my pants are really loose on me i think if i lose any more weight they will fall off ! ut 's campus really makes you work out man , i would not have even lifted a finger if i had gone to a college in houston , but this school makes you work i am taking a lot of science courses , and i hope i can handle it i talk to god at night and i hope he hears me , i hope he helps me get through all my classes successfully , i mean , my parents expect me to get all a 's dad said if i do not ' come home with a 4 0 gpa then i should not even come home that 's not fair and how come they always compare me to neema it 's not fair that i'm known as the not so good kid , even though i have never done anything bad in my life i mean for god 's sake i have never even gone on a date so why should they think i'm the bad kid i guess it 's because neema gets along with mom so much better i really wish i had a good relationship with mom , it sucks how we ca not get along ever she was right when she said yesterday that we ca not stand each other for more than a few seconds a day we just do not understand each other , she keeps lecturing me and it pisses me off there is only so much one person can stand , you know i ca not take being lectured three hundred hours a day , it makes me sick , how would you like it if someone kept telling you bla bla do not do this bla bla do not do that dad is so much easier to get along with , although he has a temper like a mofo and he is stubborn as hell ! he is such a kind gentle man , i love my dad , he works so hard for our family , i hope to repay him with success i hope he lives forever , i hope they both live forever my legs are beginning to hurt and there is a piece of hair that has fallen on my arm and it tickles me ! for some reason , i woke up this morning and my hair was curly , it was the strangest thing , usually my hair is a giant nappy fro , but today it was pretty and silky ut is not as humid as houston , and i'm glad dude i really miss nasim , she is such an awesome person i emailed her the other day , but she never ever checks her email i wonder why i never call anyone ! i feel so rude when people call me and tell me , uh how come you have not called us that 's so inconsiderate but i'm just not a phone person , i guess i really should call people back and let them know i care , i think i get this aspect of my character from mom because she does not like calling people either it 's not that i do not like talking to my friends , it 's just that i never think to call them i will though , definitely , today i will call sogol and ponta and nasim i will call stephanie and jennifer and batool well i'm sitting in a room that is covered with various books and study guides and it 's all a bit overwhelming i really hope i can handle everything , although , i seem to switch out of every class i think is too hard which is really a dumb thing to do because it means i ca not handle challenges i really need to swallow my fear and just take risks i would take risks although all my friends are grandmas and they are so cautious that i think it might be rubbing of on me too i need to go find friends that do not mind driving around campus at 2 a m but i do not want friends that drink what on earth is up with drinking what is so great about it there is no way in hell i'm going to drink so many people have told me oh do not worry marjon , you will start drinking when you get in college uhhh no i'm not , i think i know myself better than anyone else knows me and i know i'm not going to drink i do not even think i'm going to date , i'm so afraid of rejection i have been rejected a million times before in my own head that i ca not fathom going out and actually trying to get a date i mean i do not really know if people reject me , i think i'm being paranoid when i say that , sometimes a flicker of someone 's eye sparks me off and i think they do not like me i guess that makes me kind of insecure , or paranoid sometimes i make too much of situations , i over analyze and i think that what was a casual gesture was a gesture of hate i do not know what i'm getting at here , perhaps i am not a very good judge of character although if i were not a good judge of character than i would have horrible friends like nasim , nasim 's friends are absolutely terrible , they teach her bad things and they put holes in her brain she is such a pretty girl i wish she had stray away from that stuff and start studying so that she can come to ut man if you have brains and beauty , that 's a big plus in this world , everything in america is aesthetic , i have noticed that people are more inclined to talk to you if you are pretty people do not give a crap about you if you are not pretty it 's so superficial and stupid i wish people 's inner beauty could shine through , because most of the really gorgeous girls are not deep they are like a pond they are so shallow i think it is time to get up because my feet have both fallen asleep and i know when i stand they will burn like pin pricks in my fee
2003_507.txt 0 1 1 0 0 as of right now , i'm pretty happy with my life the only thing that i question are relationship issues after breaking up with my long time girlfriend 6 months ago , i have not dated any other person i think i'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend lifestyle the girls i have met as friends i might have considered them possible girlfriend material when in actuality they were not , again because i missed having a girlfriend recently , i have gotten over the issue a bit i have spent time with all my friends that 's the good thing about being single , you have more time for your friends when i was going out for my ex , which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years , i did not have much time for friends not only that , but i chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends this issue of mine , it 's made me a bit more self conscious i got the idea in my head that looks really do matter seriously though , having a deep relationship is important and yadda yadda , but i really do feel that looks matter too a friend and i were discussing this she is been there for me a lot when i broke up with my ex girlfriend , she was there for me to complain to anyways , she said that looks do not matter and it only matters a small percentage of time i argued with her saying that she is right that looks are only a small percentage but unfortunately that 's what matters at the very beginning i met this very interesting girl this summer her name is serena she was telling me about her past , how she was somewhat of a geek in high school she did not care about her looks or anything she is a very bright girl , very deep likes art and many things most girls just do not take interest anymore she said that she realized she felt she had to start dressing up to attract people first , then and only then would they be able to see the real side of her i completely agree with this there is no way people can see the real side of you unless they give you a chance and unfortunately being given a chance means you have to attract them somehow ever since then , i have gotten a bit obsessed with my physical features i never did care about it much i was in a long relationship so thoughts of attracting others did not really enter my mind during this recent period , i have started to lift weights a bit and work out my body another thought of relationships i have always wondered is at what point do you really have to settle the reality is that most likely you will never find the perfect girl when you date someone , how far into the future should you consider unfortunately for me , i should have realized in my last relationship that there was no future instead , because of my fear of being alone , i stayed with her for nearly 3 years it was fun and all , but we had many arguments the reality was we were two different people two different backgrounds , interests , ideas , practically everything my parents did not like her because she was not chinese and was not very bright ( i'm chinese by the way ) i would like to talk about my family for a second i was born in taiwan , and moved to the usa when i was four thus , i speak write fluent english but can only speak chinese ( mandarin ) since i still speak it at home i would like to think that my family is still pretty traditional , which i really like like most chinese families , my parents stressed educational when i was growing up sometimes i think this is why there is the stereotype of asians being smarter in school i think it 's because traditionally , chinese families stress education a bit more than others the bad thing about growing up in a traditional family is that living in the usa , i did not experience certain american family activities my dad never took me fishing , camping , or anything fatherly i think that was one of the things i really disliked about him growing up , i always favored my mom more now that i'm in college , i talk to my dad a lot more when i go back home , including cars , sports , politics , etc going home , i'm spoiled with food my mom is always thinking i'm going to starve to death everytime i come back up to austin , she makes me bring a whole bunch of food my grandparents ( dad 's side ) also lives very close to me in houston my grandparents came to the usa a couple of years before us , which is how we were able to i remember growing up and laying awake at night , my biggest fear in the world was that i would lose my grandpa ( to old age ) it 's still my biggest fear because he is been an avid smoker since almost forever we have tried to tell him to quit and he knows its bad for him , but he just wo not he says he has nothing better to do during the daytime , and to let him enjoy it he is even said something close to i have already experienced everything in life my family is doing good i have nothing else to live for now , do not take this to be a suicidal comment for anything , he was saying it as if it were wise words on my part , its hard to argue with him he is my grandpa and i ca not really tell him to just stop what he likes so much personally , i have a very big problem with talking to people this problem has been solved a bit ever since coming to college since there are so many people around , it 's hard to not get use to it when i'm around people , i'm always worried that what i say will make them think negatively of me that 's why i will usually always rethink what i want to say in my mind before i actually say it funny thing is , my chinese name translated to english is brave speaker i know i have a problem with caring too much what others think of me but i just ca not help it growing up i did not have that many friends , so i thought to myself a lot and that 's still true around strangers , i'm really quiet only around friends am i a bit more active and my 20 minutes are up this was pretty useful glad i could type out what i was thinking now i got to go get caught up on reading those boring chapters from the psychology book the lectures are much more interesting
2003_509.txt 0 0 0 0 0 well , first i'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment i have ever been given i would like to write about my boyfriend , whom i'm very in love with , but i really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment my roommate just left to go to her pledge party , and i really wish i was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due , but i guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute which is what i am going to try to do in all my classes , not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that i have to do ! i think that if i can just do that then i will be able to keep with all of my work and get grades in my classes that i will approve i also need to get into the college of communications so therefore i have to keep my grades up i really ca not wait to become a speech pathologist , i'm very excited about that also , god willing i really do think it would be awesome to go to the university of iowa for their graduate program in speech pathology they have the best in the nation , and plus ryan goes there and if i'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus ! ok , dee you are completely wondering around here and i'm sure whoever reads this is going think that i am a weirdo , but i really do not have much else to talk about hmmm i am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family ! i think we will have a lot of fun and i'm excited that i get to leave tomorrow to go home and do not have to wait until friday i'm having loss of words at the moment and someone just imed me uhh oh , have to tell him to hold on ! ok i did lets get back on track here i'm curious as to who gets to read these because i bet that would be a lot of fun i'm sure that there are lots of different things said on each persons assignment gosh only 8 minutes of typing ! is this ever going to end ! ( hey i'm being honesty here ! ) i bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than i am , but i really am typing my thoughts and feelings actually i'm typing the first thing that pops into my head , which is probably why this is making no sense at all i think that sitting here and typing out what i'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what i would really be thinking about , because i'm trying to find something to think about that i can type about wow that was a confusing sentence i'm surprised at how much fun i'm having here i honestly thought that i would become homesick and miss everything back home and i also thought i would miss ryan a lot more than i am i mean i do miss him , yes ! but there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things not complaining because i'm glad i'm not sitting around moping about him , i need to enjoy life , especially college life ! i really ca not wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls the girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you , but i'm sure if i was a guy i probably would not mind sitting here wondering what i'm going to type next i'm not supposed to be planning anything out , which i'm not , but sometimes i just do not think about anything i do not always have to have something on my mind do i much less a feeling feelings are sometimes so over rated simply type continuously , tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes well i just re read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought , so i had to type it ok 5 more minutes to go , i'm almost there ! gee i did not realize how often i just do not think about stuff , but i usually do think a lot about different things , i guess just not now i consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker , and have more mature thoughts than other people that i know take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm yeah theta ! very loud , annoying , and obnoxious yes these are the people i am living with , sweet girls but nothing like me i do not get into all the sorority stuff times running out whoo hoo ! now i can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment which is , i must say the easiest graded assignment i have ever done ! so i think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this good idea huh now i can think about is how i want this to end i have about a minute to go so i will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and i hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and feelings for 20 minutes of my life sorry if i bored you , which i probably did but its ok , i'm really not a boring person ! well have a good day and goodbye !
2003_510.txt 1 1 0 0 0 well , i am almost ready to leave tomorrow back to my house in fort worth , although i would like it to be better to go back because since i have to work tomorrow , that makes it kind of boring and i cannot stop thinking about work instead of enjoy my time over there every time i go i always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend , that actually never really happens , i do not really know how i feel about it because sometimes i feel frustrated that i cannot do anything about it but then i analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head the fist thing i have to do before i leave is get all my homework done , including this assignment that i did not want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does since the first day that i slept in this dorm , it seems that the bed is not for me or something , i cannot fall asleep , and if i do , i wake up every 20 min and look at my clock to see if it 's time to go to class i remember i used to love school when i was in high school last year , everything was so cool , nothing was going so bad to call it bad , grades , girlfriend , family money , but now some times i feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with , i cannot handle so much stress , never had so much actually anyways , the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because i know i'm not a failer hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good ! the biggest problem that i have and that i think already gave me a pain in my neck , well that 's because i cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so i think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems i have to pay my whole semester rent next monday , that 's one of the reasons i'm going home tomorrow , to get a juicy check that will just fly away from my hands i only i was living in my house and going to a college near , i would be able to keep all that money and use it to get rid of my debt and actually be able to buy a gift for my girlfriend i have bunches of pictures of her all around my room i also have pictures of my mother and little sister she is 6 and i miss her i hope tonight i can fall asleep easy so i wo not be tired during my 2 hour drive everytime i drive tired i get nervous and think that i may fall asleep and all these thoughts come to my mind that i'm going to crash a big truck and never make it home i know that the odds are really small and then i get better once i start listening to this exact same music i'm listening to right now its a band called mana , is from mexico and they play really good kidda alternative music but is really meaningful and then they talk about world peace and they help children with massive foundations , with no doubt my favorite band they are coming to dallas next october , i ca not wait till then to go to the concert , i went to one last november and i still remember almost every second of it , this time i'm thinking on taking my girlfriend to make the concert even better i just hope that i will have money to but the tickets then , cause now i do not jeje , a few hours ago i was doing my physics homework , it 's just really hard , when i was in high school i was the best kid on physics and now i just feel really bad when i do not understand ! , never happened before , i do not know if is because i cannot concentrate or because it 's just really hard or because i'm loosing my intelligence , i think of that all the time , i have this scholarship that is helping me a lot with my finances but if my gpa goes down 3 0 , they will take it away and then i will really be in deep trouble i just saw a picture or one of the pictures i have of my girlfriend in my room and that reminded me that i have to ask her if her dad said yes ! finally we have been going out for almost a year and she just turned 18 last saturday , i was a really nice night , the problem is that her father does not know about us yet , we are afraid we might not like our relationship and then all would fall down i feel guilty for making her disobey her dads rules but we love each other and finally i would be the happiest guy ever if i can make it trough this semester maintaining a good gpa and if my girlfriends dad agrees on our relationship when i think of these , it feels like everything is worth it to wait and suffer and not sleep and study like crazy , so that 's what i'm going to do
2003_511.txt 0 0 0 0 0 how to begin , i have started writing my stream of consciousness paper and now i'm trying to think its hard to think when your are asked to think about thought or your own thought why i feel this is a strange assignment o well i do not smell much right now but i hear the tv which i fixed last night i did a pretty good job even though i still have an extra screw left i'm watching scooby doo its very funny to watch now the commercials are on which i hate its 3 11 tonight i'm going out to eat and to the book store with my friends and maybe to an art museum i'm glad i get to get off campus the football game and weekend start tomorrow i'm excited to see the texas arkansas game as the season progresses the competition will become harder the band is a neat experience i have always liked marching and now i get to do it for a very widely known organization its a lot of fun i have only been typing for 3 minutes this is going to be a long 20 minutes there is nothing i can do to make it go by quicker even if i type slower , no i'm trying to find something else to think about , so i am disrupting my stream which is ironic that i have not really because i'm on a new one and recording it right now which is even more ironic and it will never end until now so her ei am looking for my new stream and hoping this assignment will be over soon so i can start my weekend and maybe get some food i'm very hungry now i have not eaten all day and i'm hungry now i need to get some food , maybe ill get some chick fil a or taco cabana or some kind of fast food most likely seems like that and cafeteria food is all i eat lately its not a very good realization drew just walked in the door he is my roommate he just asked how i watch scooby doo its so mundane he uses vocabulary to impress people and i just wrote it in my paper to impress people very ironic as well john ridder died today he is the star on threes company and 8 simple rules and he died on set suddenly its a weird thing i would like to live a long life and maybe die suddenly tho and not have to know i'm dying although i'm not afraid to die i feel i have a place to go though , my afterlife is set many people here do not believe in god and i do not know why it seems to me to be the only answer we have not even figured out the human brain and we dare to declare that there is no being beyond our comprehension we can be a very proud society for a people that ca not stop murdering and slaughtering each other anyways i have been trying to help people understand that christ came to give love and to break us away from sin not to tell us how to live i guess that makes me intolerant many people here feel that me showing what i believe is imposing my culture on them which i guess could be true but i'm not trying to break them from their traditions i'm just trying to my roommate just started talking , arafat refuses to leave , and the usa is blatantly pro israel no , if the us was blatantly pro israel world war three begins i stopped following the conversation with california governors my roommates friend is here now and they are arguing politics , current affairs , the such , scooby doo caught the bad guy , i'm satisfied now , man my fingers hurt and this writing is getting very tiring i wish i could be done now but i have to keep writing they are talking about proposition 12 now bla bla its very hard to concentrate on two things at once but i guess that is what college is about my physics homework is next to me i'm very glad i am understanding most of it i was proud of myself today because i finished most of my hw which is due next monday we have an exam in two weeks and i think i will do very well i also have an exam in this class and i'm very not prepared hopefully i can sit down and read through the text we will have to have read thus far and begin to see what this class will teach me i also remember that i have to do some experiment hours for this class hopefully i will have some free time in the weekend ahead to do some of them i am beginning to smell food man i am so hungry i'm not thinking about much now because i am so focused on how hungry i am and what i would like to eat yet i'm thinking about thinking about what i want to eat and so forth this assignment is very weird because you ca not have people record what they think because now they are thinking about it so its in a way rigged and it will always be there is now way like this to have people understand how they think because whenever they think about it the point is gone , the twilight zone is on now i love that show me and drew are collecting the videos of them we have 12 episodes now and they are all classic ones the shows are not only always very ironic but they have social issues of the time in them which is very good , i like them , i have seen a lot of movies lately maybe because that is the easiest way to divert myself , its weird how humans always need diversion and now when i ca not even write my thoughts i have to divert myself by talking about diversion man i ca not wait to see what heaven has to offer , soon enough , only 20 seconds left now i ca not wait till heaven its almost here three two one z
2003_512.txt 0 0 1 0 1 well here i am doing my first assignment for college i really like it so far i had some problems with my course schedule at first but it all seemed to fall into place my life is like that though everything seems to just work i do not know if i am the only person that feels like this ( i doubt it ) but i feel like i will accomplish something big in my life or at least be happy with my life but i do not have a clue what it is that i will be doing my dad seems to get pissed whenever i tell him that i do not know what i want to do with my life but other adults think that it is a good thing i think that it is because they do not fund my bill my dorm room is freezing i am going home this weekend to get some sweats and such my girlfriend is in town to get her stitches looked at ( she had surgery ) i hope she is ok we have been going out for awhile now and i think i love her i know that i am 19 and do not know what love is but it just feels so right she is in her last year of college at sfa now so i will only get to see her once a month or so everyone says to break up but it is only one year then she ( hopefully ) will come to ut i do not understand the idea that breaking up is a good plan i mean maybe if i was one of those people that just love to be in love i would but it is not that i miss the physical part ( though i do ) i miss her someone else wo not replace that i want her not a body now to bore you out of your minds , i am very interested in nutrition bodybuilding i played football for 4 years and weighed in at a fat laden 290 lbs my sophomore year of high school but hey that is ok you play football well i quit due to many factors and guess what it is not ok to just be fat i have worked my butt off literally i now am 200 lbs and have gained strength i estimate myself at 13 body fat but i want to do better and i know that i can i spend a lot of time researching various aspects of training and diets i think it may be dominating my life but it is not a hobby it is a lifestyle but really who else eats every 2 hours and for that matter what the heck do they eat on campus i have these cursed dine in dollars but i can only eat about 3 things here everything is terrible for you ! i am not exaggerating ok maybe i can eat 5 things but come on ! why do we not have fat free cottage cheese lean beef real grilled chicken not the baby pieces i am paying for now why is it always free pizza at 11 at night complex carb late night fat why no free tuna , or free vegetables why is gregory closed from 8 12 05 ! so what if i am not in the friggin weight class i know how to lift better than they do let me in ! i worked in a weight room for 2 years you think i ca not be courteous and rack my weights or get out of others way let them work in etc come on want to fight the freshmen 15 get better food ! we were ranked last in dorm food last texas should never be last in anything except for people you wan to fight this is outrageous ok now that i have ranted and let that out i want to know if there is anything i can do about it no there is not how many students would eat fat free cottage cheese or tuna straight from the can not enough to get the food people to bring it in oh well survive this year and move off campus next year with my girlfriend and eat right and be happy ! something just buzzed in my room my hands are numb spend the a c on some real food !
2003_513.txt 1 0 0 1 1 crap , i was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something i really hope it did not already submit because i do not want to screw up my credit for this paper great , now i'm completely paranoid that i have managed to screw up something so simple i will keep my fingers crossed i need all the help i can get to do well in this class actually , i have not worried about my grades in a long time when tests start , i will panic it 's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures i never get enough rest my schedule 's all out of order i ca not fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven i'm tired all day long i hear my tv and want to go watch it i always put stuff off and watch too much television i have a problem with procrastinating i never used to be this bad i'm scared that since i ca not get on a study plan , i will fail i hate it when i over use a word when i'm writing i feel like i have not written enough , but does length matter my birthday is next week , which somewhat depresses me i'm not close to any of my friends , and i'm scared they are going to forget about me i feel like the only loser out of my friends who 's not having this great college experience it 's not that i'm homesick , just kind of restless and bored i have not met that many people and frankly , feel like an outcast my head hurts , but i have no tylenol i hate swallowing pills i used to break them up and put them in yogurt i'm such a wuss my roommate went home for the afternoon i'm glad she is gone she can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness i went out of town one weekend , and she made my bed i do not really want her invading my space and touching my things
2003_514.txt 0 0 0 0 1 stream of consciousness how do you start something so vague i keep a journal which i write in occasionally , but i can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts i would be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness , because that is definitely what i am feeling right now it 's late monday night and i am taking this time to break up the reading that i have fallen behind in while i am technically still studying psychology , it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text what is the point of this assignment anyway how could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind i guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject the human mind there really is no other single entity ( besides the female mind ) which is so complex and irregular humans are an interesting study , which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology , sociology and history but psychology really is the king of the social sciences , it 's all but required for a college student i could not believe how stereotypical i felt when i uttered the phrase my psych class , it 's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet now that i mentioned the greek societies on our campus , i would like to delve into that a little after overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of kinsolving today , ( they travel in packs ) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that sororities and fraternities actually limit social interaction sure it 's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick , but i honestly do not feel compelled to join a fraternity free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season , but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality fraternity issues become the mindset of the member , and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person , be they in the same frat or not , is almost always taken advantage of yes , some fraternities do some good community work , but it limits people into one train of thought , their loyalty is admirable to the members , but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded of course , coming from a freshman non frat male , that sounds like every other person with an opinion , ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality i really do not oppose the fraternity sorority concept , because it is a need some people truly need filled but the sight of another party where 70 of the attendance is male , 20 are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people , and the other 10 are passed out , it makes them all seem the same i feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody , but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the kappa party or the pi phi foam bash , but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked out of those parties i feel definitely stereotypical again , from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties , could i possibly be the more prototypical male well , here 's the sinker , it 's time to discuss sports i cover them for a newspaper , but honestly i'm just like another fan , but willing to put in the work too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio , it 's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space any fan with a computer can put together that the cowboys are in a rebuilding year , but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices , meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story i guess i am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take' about the latest controversy regarding sports that 's not to say that all of them are garbage , but too many of them i find repetitive and dull , and bringing nothing new to the argument covering a sport is different than giving an opinion , and i enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air i love the hunt , and that not only makes me strange , but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer of course , as a college freshman , i really do not have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling , but i figure the experience could not hurt much like my decision to take this psychology class , it may seem stereotypical , but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others my time is up , i am sorry to whoever is reading this , it must seem very much like the others i'm sure , but i look forward to this class and i thank you for this very interesting assignment
2003_515.txt 1 0 0 1 0 so here goes i am really starting to stress out about all this college stuff it seems like my to do list just keeps getting longer and the time i have to complete everything just keeps shrinking i hope and pray that as time goes by i will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life it has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work but as my brother once told me , you must work hard in order to play hard i'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly , and keep thinking positive about my situation i'm hoping that i can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come well enough about that i'm really starting to miss my family a lot i think that is really lame but i ca not help it really like i love austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of sunnyvale , texas that i miss incredibly i went home last weekend and had a blast reuniting with all my old friends gosh i love my friends here but its just not the same there is just something about the familiar that keeps me constantly wanting to latch on to it and never leave but i know that that is impossible for someone like me who constantly strives to better myself and achieve my goals and ut is the place to do it i love this place ! the people sometimes freak me out but its nice to be exposed to strange people for a change i am so excited about this weekend ! one of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and i keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend ! gosh you know what i'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15 theory ! because i sure do eat a lot these days the food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist ! its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you no here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it ! its great ! its amazing to me how different college life is from high school like in high school everyone cared about everyone else 's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here no one cares about anyone else 's business at all people are just concerned with themselves and another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules ! like you can do whatever the heck you want and no one will tell you that you are wrong or that you ca not do something oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking , you can ! i laugh every time i see people doing that in my classes i would never be able to make myself do that because i'm too much of a chicken but i think its so funny ! gosh i'm really starting to get hungry again that is so bad ! no ! i ca not eat again ! i am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm that is really late and i'm extremely tired ! i really hope that i can find a date to anchors away that is really bugging me i wish i knew exactly who i wanted to take and who wanted to go so that i would not have to worry about it anymore ! alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so i'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me haha ! this was good its kind of a way to let your problems go all at once i actually feel better to get all this out and see my thoughts on paper not to mention that i feel better knowing that this writing assignment is out of my hair so that is one less thing i have to worry and stress out about well that is all i have to say for myself at this point and time ! peace !
2003_530.txt 0 1 0 0 1 sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing there 's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 20 minutes and try and make it completely coherent the music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue adversaries in between as if rapids in the path the sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest the light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside i watch my friends sit next to me one is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm , the other sits and types quietly the music is quieter now with bell like rings in it the bass has a slow but progressive sound to it the guitar sings about as the music moves on over the middle window , the one with the blinds shut , we keep the blue mask it has sharp looking teeth which are yellow the teeth match the horns i'm now half past the time of when i started some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs sorry for the time of which i slacked i loosing ideas of what to write now i have little more to to tell of my surroundings more the music is now more of a popping sounds it also mud like sounding guitar now my phone is ringing now but i got my friend to pick it up i will call them back this is now the end
2003_534.txt 0 0 1 0 1 my roommate just had a sandwich from subway , and the smell is killing me it 's one of my favorite things to eat he gets somewhat annoying , though right now he is playing a video game , and he is got the volume turned way up i do not mind so much it 's just hard to get my thoughts straight i hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth i always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again , but it is so good everything i am saying sounds really stupid i guess that 's how the mind works though i have never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts most of them just kind of run through my head , with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts he ( my roommate ) keeps talking to his game it 's getting old the game is cool though a bit violent but very addictive it even gets a little scary at night some of the time nights are so weird here it always feels a lot later than it is , or not late enough i always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time i remember it 's too late to be calling the east coast i do not know where my relationship with her is going we have been dating for almost four years maybe i should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying would that offend him though i do not know i do not know about a lot of things and i just realized that i just used the word do not know the internet lingo is getting out of hand i used to be online almost all day long he is still talking at least i can look forward to the game this weekend for once i wo not mind the noise it 's kind of exciting my first texas game i am so bored i really need to meet people being from out of state definitely has its downside everyone seems to know everybody here and that does not help me very much it seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself , but that 's what i have to do or i will be spending a lot of time in my dorm room that , my friend , was a run off sentence , but i'm much too lazy to correct it right now stayed up too late last night because i do not have any classes today i should really finish my homework after this , but i am way too lazy for that there it goes my roommate made me lose where i was going with that last thought i'm kind of thirsty right now , i should get a bottle of water the austin water is gross i'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it we have been buying water left and right we should really get a brita filter this game really is addicting i just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 30 seconds i do not think that it 's a good thing to do that this whole writing is filled with vague pronoun references my 11th grade english ( is that supposed to be capitalized ) would murder me if she knew i was writing like this , but i suppose it is okay as long as i do not get into the habit of writing this way i am really slack i'm only taking 13 hours this semester and i still do not do any homework at least i am doing okay on my graded assignments oh well this is college life and for once i'm not going to have my mom around to push me to study and do my work the timer seems like it is moving a lot slower now than before just like when i'm running it always takes so much longer for 20 minutes to pass when i'm on one the treadmill very dull , indeed
2003_540.txt 0 1 1 0 1 today i went to class at 8am i did not want to get up at all even though i slept by 11pm , it was really hard to wake up this morning i do not look forward towards tuesdays and thursdays my first class today at 8am was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful also , when i got up there i did not learn a bit you know how in charlie brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah , the teacher 's aid voice just seemed to trail away as the class neared the end , i left early so that i could go home and catch a couple of z 's before my next class which was at 11am soon as i got home , i just fell asleep almost instantaneously for some odd reason , i had a dream of home maybe i do miss it more than i think by 10 30am , i woke up to get myself prepared for the next class i left late and arrived to class late , leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door taking notes is such a pain in the ass , when trying to use your legs as a desk i just sat there thinking about the repetitive information then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example , i blanked out and started to think about what i should do when i get home ( back to my dorm ) and that i needed to study for a quiz the next class after the very monotonous class was over , i head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate i think he is feeling the same way as i do , tired , hungry , nostalgic , and lethargic after lunch , i got prepared for my quiz i ended up studying for 10 minutes at most i should have studied more but i was not up to it after studying a little , i watched the news and then headed for a class i also went to that class a little late for some reason , today has just been an off day i think i did rather well on that quiz and the information did not seem like it was out of this world i guess the best way to track my feelings thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way i felt and thought about my day i feel like this day was pointless in some way and that i should have done something productive it seems like i always feel like that the only thing i have achieved today was canceling my friend 's plane ticket from northwest arkansas to austin she was coming to watch the old rivals play i cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation other than that i set up my new computer and caught up with the news in iraq and in california and also the hurricane in the atlantic ocean i think i need to be motivated more someone to tell me that i need to go do something or someone to go do something with i guess it 's because i am feeling nostalgia back at home , i usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever but in this new setting and the freedom , i have not done too much maybe i am doing more than the usual because i have finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and i'm just thinking that i need to do more i guess it will take me a while to get use to the college life
2003_541.txt 1 0 1 1 1 ben stiller and his movies crack me up i wish i was up stairs watching it right now and not writing for 20 minutes on what is on my mind but maybe this way i will tap into my subconscious or something my girlfriend is not answering her phone but she always does i wonder what she is doing i'm happy that i'm going to dallas to see her but last night she was making me mad by hanging around other guys and at all these parties i like ut but i think i would have a much better time at smu with her , not only would i be with her a lot more but i like the school better and its not so overwhelming and is a lot smaller i feel bad for lying to her the other night about having our neighbors , some girls over , but whatever i mean she goes over to guys apts to hang out and i mean since i'm the dominant male figure i guess that inviting girls over means that you like them or something whatever it just does not register right , i mean like its cool for her to go to a guys apt , but its not for me to have chicks over , like that is not fair and its not like i like any of these girls its just that i want to be social and have girls as friends just as much as she does you know its weird that i have these feelings but i almost feel like i could spend the rest of my life with her she is fun witty sexy as hell blonde rich great person in her heart and i think everything that a guy would want , although she has great things about her there is also some downsides like in party situations i always find her wondering off and talking to her friends and when i come up to her she acts almost as if she does not know me is she ashamed i do not think so but it could seem that way to others but maybe its because i do it to , i mean when i'm at a party i like to be with my friends to so i guess were both guilty damn that movie meet the parents is funny and i want to go watch it badly and i have only typed for 10 min , o well halfway done so its like the glass is half full not half empty because i am a positive , optimist i like the new book jarrett gave me sometimes i'm just real un positve about things and a book on being positive can help me out in life and with school this interview or presentation i went to last night for this sales company was pretty cool i think i could potentially make some money doing it but as i sat there and listened to this over energetic guy talk about oh yea you can make all this money and blah blah blah i thought to myself this is just one of those get rich quick schemes because at the end of this thing you pay 50 for a application and some of there products , what company just lets you sit through a presentation and bam you got the job jarrest going to do it so i think since he has been successful in his endeavors with business and sales i think hey why not give it a try what is the worst that can happen bud sounds good right now although i have not smoked in a while i wonder why , i guess its cause i act different when i'm stoned and maybe i do not like it , i like to get high after i workout cause for some reason it feels good and makes me feel as if i'm not just a lazy pothead , is pennebaker going to care that i'm talking about this o well that is what is on my mind so take it or leave it jk yea i'm almost done with this , i thought this was going to be a formal paper with research and stuff but what a badass assignment , i think i'm going to like this teacher unlike my eco teacher wolitz i ca not stand her ugly face and bad teaching i just do not like her you know just one of those ppl i bombed her test today to because she is boring and does not make the class want to learn anything
2003_544.txt 1 1 0 0 1 as i'm sitting here at my computer i'm thinking about how bad i started off this semester i know that i should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking , but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses i'm also thinking how tired i am from staying up all night studying in the back of my mind i'm hoping to get this work study job so that i can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school , considering how i took 12 hours and worked this summer i keep smelling my cologne ( ck1 ) that i accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning a lot more came out then i expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else had i not been so tired maybe i would have realized that i only needed a couple of drops not to mention everywhere i have went today people either say , someone put on to much cologne , or , you smell good i 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time i'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner my brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work i need to do i'm homesick already i miss my family and i have only been here a couple of weeks i did not expect this my sophomore year i thought it only happened to freshmen i feel really hungry too i have not ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal i feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at gregory i'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team but with my luck they wo not have tryouts for the second year in a row i wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges i wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as i did probably not because they all play sports i think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you do not you wo not play i think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes they think they have it easy and that they get free grades they do not they have a job there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired while fighting through the daily soreness and injuries , they have to try to get school work done i think that is tough i have sympathy for them i hope that i can get everything done today that needs to be done and also i plan on changing my shirt before this ck1 gives me a headache i probably will never wear ck1 again i hope all my friends and family are doing well i plan to get some good sleep tonight also , of course after all my work is done time is running out so bye

2003_554.txt 0 1 0 0 1 the start of this semester has been again full of stress and anxiety i wake up everyday depressed and knowing that the day will only bring about more problems it is a bit pessimistic of me but this is what i am used to for instance , right now i can feel my head throbbing because of my headache the only reason i have it in the first place is because of school the hardships of being a pre med student have already taken a toll on me and sometimes i think i'm not strong enough to continue the only think that keeps me going is the thought of one day making my parents proud yet , this means that i have to do extremely well in all of my classes and for the past year i have done far from that i constantly worry about my gpa and not getting into medical school and it gets to a point where i tune out everything else i'm even thinking about my chances at medical school right now typing this diary this is the sad truth about me and i try to cope with it i remember in the summer i had lost all care of school and gpa and i was finally happy and in a world of peace i had thought that my return back to school would be much for more exciting because i had stopped worrying about this whole pre med issue sadly , i'm here again thinking about it non stop its almost like i go to school to impress my family rather than trying to have a fun filled 4 years why is it so difficult to become a doctor if you know that its what you want to do why do i have to compete with my peers for the few spots open in medical schools sometimes these questions drive me nuts i try my best to distract myself from it like right now i'm listening to the rain hit my window the sound of it crashing my window is so soothing and peaceful and i wish i was just outside splashing around my life has turned into this academic challenge and i hardly have time for myself and my needs i guess that 's why i join organizations then again , they make matters only worse when they share with me how wonderful their gpas are i would do freshmen year all over again in a heartbeat if someone ever gave me the chance i regret the recklessness i showed toward my work , thinking it was all going to be a piece of cake like high school maybe that is why i make my brother study so much i never want him to make the mistakes i made yet am i ruining his own social life by doing this i believe i do not i think that in the end he will be thankful because he wo not have to worry about taking 17 hours very semester just to raise his gpa so that schools will think of him as competitive i wish sometimes i had had a guide my roommate from last year was a business major and all he did was read a textbook for 10 minutes and then watch tv and i would undoubtedly get dragged in it makes me so angry to think that i was so immature and nonchalant on a side note , i have never ranted so much before especially on the computer it 's kinda helping me to take off mental burden that i carry however , staring at this bright monitor is only increasing my headache anyways , i basically just frustrate myself over this whole medical school dilemma i wish i could just go into the future and not have to worry about this anymore the day i get the acceptance letter ( or rejection letter ) will be the happiest day of my life i will probably try again the next year but it wo not matter to me as much anymore i do not really know how to explain it but that same anxiety that goes with first times wo not be there anymore i have considered many majors and have really thought about doing something else with my life but somehow i'm always dragged back into medicine maybe its the challenge that i like even though at times i would gladly give it up maybe i worry so much about my future because i really want to see myself become a doctor this is truly my passion and i will never give up on it no matter how hard it gets at times i just hope i'm not the only one going through this hysteria because it would really make me look like a psychopath after this even so , something tells me that i'm not alone out there and sometimes that just brightens up my day even if it 's for a short while

2003_566.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i am in my room right now typing with my tv turned on to mtv channel it 's playing justin timberlake song i just got back from my biochemistry i class and the professor in that class seems very boring i noticed that he never stop talking in his lecture which makes it hard for me because i feel like i missed a lot of what he said while i was taking notes i ca not seem to take notes and listen well at the same time i feel i'm more of a single tasked person besides the music going on in my room , the water cooker is almost , and i can hear it 's boiling right now and i think i need to check on it before the water boils over i will be back well , i'm back this week will be a tiring week for me since i have so much to catch up with anthropology reading i pretty much understand my biochemistry professor after a few lectures of how he is not good in lecturing , so that means i have to spend more time reading and studying , which definitely sucks my other teachers are okay and i seem to absorb a lot in their lectures i do not think i can work out much this week and i maybe be able to work out next thursday and saturday plans for weekends are unsure since i have not made any hopefully , there will be something fun that my friends will invite me to i had already met some people in my dorm , but i have not really met people in my classes i also met the people from longhorn pre pharmacy association man , there is going to be a football game this coming saturday and i do not think i can usher again in the football for the longhorn pre pharmacy since i have not finished much in my school work and have not played really since a long time ago i hope this week and this weekend wo not turn out to be terrible it 's unexpected that somehow right now i feel more energetic than when i was about an hour ago when i was in biochemistry class maybe professors have a lot of effect on student 's energy level or maybe the breakfast that i ate about 3 hours ago now is starting kick in something about the song in mtv just made me looked at the screen it 's r kelly in a japanese culture setting , which made me look longer because i am from an asian culture in america , asian culture is not that widely dispersed , so it 's good to see it every so often as i'm watching a fighting scene in that r kelly mtv , i think america has a misleading view toward asian culture because whenever there is something with asian culture , there has to be martial art , which is misleading because asian culture is not just about martial art instead , we have other things i do not feel like listing them right now it 's good to see rap songs are being more popular because it shows america is diverse and multi culture speaking of culture , in my anthropology class , we are discussing about culture i have a lot to read on the forest people , who are people have very different culture from western and eastern culture the book is

2003_666.txt 1 0 0 1 1 i have been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people , using them as test subjects , objectifying human beings , i really feel that it degrades their very being i do not understand another human 's need to study and examine what makes another human tick i wish that i could say that i am exempt from this curiosity , but sadly i am not i find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs , in causes , in religion they somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they are involved in is important , means something , when in reality 100 of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them none of it will rally matter once these people are gone , and the strange thing is that i think they all know this deep down , they have all had that thought in their life before yet they still go on , slaving their lives away , building the modern day pharaoh 's modern day pyramids just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth god only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations which raises another good topic , religion , now everyone knows that religion is make believe for grown ups , just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way religion as we know it was made to control the masses , sort of a justification for law , and also something that keeps people inline above law , like a conscience but the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake we teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction it 's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters , as if one is even different that the others , they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy , keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives in tribal societies religion does not have to be forced on the new generation , rather they welcome it with open arms , just as they are not forced to work in their lives , rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society people allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me , it 's clear that people can live , sustain life , off very little , and will slave their lives away rather than die however i ca not comprehend how our society got to this point , where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass we somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones , computers , tv 's , cars , when it 's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago people actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years , people just like you and me , people just as smart , and just as naive it 's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around , the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians , but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live , that we have so enlighten found people lived without all this none sense that we tell ourselves we could not live without for nearly 3 million years but those are all things that no one wants you to know , except maybe daniel quinn , derrick jensen , john zerzan , and chuck palahniuk those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it is not already too late the doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now , that is the point of no return , if things stay the way that they are now , there will be no hope for the future if we had all just stayed with animism , and believed that the earth is not something for us to own , or control , if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive , how could we take away their right to the same land we live on but there are no classes teaching what people really want to know , what they need to know , only classes perpetuating our way of life only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we do not even notice so why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world now i realize that my writing may sound bleak , as if i'm in a state of utter depression , that i'm innately sad , but it 's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should , and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all we keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks , making executioner executive decisions but humans should not need pills to control their feelings , they should not need pills to make them happy , they should not need pills to force their inner feelings into submission it pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society , and the people that do not see it , if it is not already here our phones are tapped , our emails are spied on , the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous people wake up everyday and take zoloft , prosac , ritalin , adderol , valium , zanex , anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior , to keep them inline anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is , anything to keep them so fucked up they just do not care anymore anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out , there is no hope for the future we are writing now , at least none that includes us for a species that holds it self in such hich regard , the top of the food chain , the center of the universe , in our own special classification , we sure act stupidly if we were to open our eyes we would see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions , with drugged up kids , both pharasudically , and illegally , allowing oppression , deforestation , slavery , pollution , and the lot to continue everyday , infact they make sure it grows , because you ca not stop progress they are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission , so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over i'm here to tell you that no such place exists , god is just santa clause for adults where was god when the twin towers were hit , where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man , where was god when the germans were killing the jews , where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they do not even notice when they are doing it to their own children i for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land everyday we scorch the earth with new roads , we rip the earth apart for new buildings , we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system no one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here , before civilization no one had to work , in fact tribal people have no concept of work , they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living , doing whatever it is that they want to we have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable , lazy , pointless , a waste , yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless , just as wasteful only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born , because the way we live is so heinous , so vile , so wrong that our children ca not handle it , and for the most part neither can we we could change everything in one generation , if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself , but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right , that this is the way things must be and that there 's nothing we can do about it people cannot risk being overwhelmed by the anxiety which might accompany a full cognitive and affective grasp of the present world situation and its implications for the future grimspoon jg4ever
2004_1.txt 1 1 1 0 0 i am eating a hershey 's bar with almonds i told myself that i would only eat one little square of it , but as i can see , that did not happen you would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite , but actually it 's making me more hungry for more sweets that 's interesting as i'm typing , those little notices that people are signing on aol instant messenger keep popping up , and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words i have already typed , so i have to keep going back and deleting and starting over annoying over the labor day weekend , which happened to include my birthday , by the way on that note , i used to not like having a birthday so near a quote holiday because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned , and i would not be able to get together with all of them now that i have entered college ( smile ) , i have grown in two short weeks to love having a long weekend for my birthday to spend with special people ( bigger smile ) anyways , this weekend ( my computer did that thing again ) i celebrated my 18th birthday with my family and my best friend my mom used to attend ut austin , in fact , both of my parents did unfortunately , due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home anyways , she is a registered nurse , although she took maternity leave long ago , and at the moment she 's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle elementary years my dad is a self employed architect he used to work for a large corporation in dallas , but hardly had time to have a life a life away from work , that is my mom likes to say that when i was a baby , she would have to show me a picture ahhhh ! my best friend just called ! she would say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say look , there 's your daddy now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams , and attending soccer practices , and taxi ing him to karate class and piano lessons my little brother , matthew , was born when i was nearing 10 years old currently he is seven years old , in second grade he came as a huge surprise , being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile but obviously , as my case proved , they were wrong he is very active , and shows so much love that i do not know how such a little body can produce it right now he 's almost infatuated with copying my best friend , patrick speaking of patrick , i met him in high school we both attended health careers high school , a magnet school in san antonio by chance , we have had a few classes together over the years , and , by chance , we only just met each other at the end of senior year that was largely due to our parent 's cooperative involvement in putting together project graduation for our senior class , to be held the night of graduation actually , we have been aware of each others presence for awhile now , being as how our school is relatively small in size , housing around 1000 students total around 204 in my class i did not get to what i was saying , but i guess i will leave the juicy stuff for next time
2004_2.txt 1 0 1 1 1 seriously in my mind right now i have so many levels of thought that i can easily access by simply starting to think about something , everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once i analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what i think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is , because everything has its specific purpose a lot of things that i thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our ( human ) use and that is what they are specifically there for everything is for us humans everything we utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can this alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade , making sure that on one takes any along the way if someone takes our lemonade , we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much when and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back but if someone drinks it then we ca not get it back , so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do basically , this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person the more people widely accept a thought , the more it is thought to be what we think as normal but just because a thought is not in everyone 's mind , then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy in our minds , social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are weird but this is the main problem with our world if everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time , please pardon my language but i felt i must stress the importance of the statement may i please stress it again damn , there i did it there is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why they must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be people that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed i see the irony in my statements above because i said simply that we must accept the world for what it is , but here 's the thing i have personally not yet learned to do this because i still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that i wish to change or eradicate the fact that people do not just accept the world and people in their out of the ordinary state of minds for just the way that it is simply put the way that it is the way that it is if i could understand that then i believe that i will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach i am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than i ever thought i could be i do not think there are any major flaws in our world that i cannot look at with an open mind and accept , if you will i say if you will because i feel that accept may not properly convey what it is that i am trying to express by accept , i mean look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why well who knows and it is okay not to know i need not know the meaning of everything but i have a deep appreciation for it there it is i have a deep appreciation for it i was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world i appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people 's personalities and i choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind no one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it i feel it with everything that i do and i only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities ( without bearing harm to others of course , because that is the definite

2004_5.txt 1 1 1 0 0 well another week of classes has started and i ca not wait until this weekend i just want to relax for a while there is so much to do during the week i start on one thing then i have to work on something else there is like ten million things to do i am taking these hard classes and i hate them i have to read a lot of course , but oh well i have a quiz tomorrow in my bio 211 discussion class gosh i hope am ready i really want to do well its my first quiz am going to be nervous i did study some last night i am extremely tired because i stayed up late looking over stuff for bio 211 i feel i am not fully prepared but then i study so hard i go take the quiz and what if i fail i hate that feeling i study so much but then my hard work wont pay off i feel so awful that i cry , i know crying does not do anything but its just you work so hard and you want to do well i am going to study some more tonight though i want to go over to jester and go to the learning center for my calculus homework due soon gosh so much to do today right now am just tired and hungry i ate junk food last night the cafeteria was closed and i just did not feel like going down to the strip by myself i just always want someone there with me i am scared though to walk on the strip by myself maybe this weekend i will walk on the strip in the afternoon by myself i want to go look at the stores and just walk and chill out i am just stalk in this cubicle just putting my head into the books its like i need to get out get some fresh air its just am so stressed and i know i got too much to do its like i do not even have 10 minutes to just relax there is so many things to do on campus and i want to join clubs and get to know some new people i want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a persian club that would be fun i want to meet some persian people on campus since i am persian too its fun to meet someone from your own culture you can relate to them and stuff i just need to get out there and explore my possibilities i need to join some clubs not just for writing in you resumes but for fun and to learn and explore and also to meet people who are also interested in the same things you are i want to go to the medical field so i need to join some medical organizations i am sure there are many of them i am a biology major and now am thinking to change my major to psychology i think psychology will be an interesting field i talked to my cousin who recently graduated from medical school and she said it would be a great idea i want to do something that i am interested in and like to study biology is hard but any subject is hard , but now the classes am taking i am just not having fun and its really stressing me out and i want to do something that i will enjoy and i want to get into medical school i am sure every person who applies to medical school like probably most of them are biology majors i do not want to be a biology major i want to stand out i want to be different i also think that if i do not get into medical school then what am i going to do with a biology major besides teaching and maybe working in the lab , but is it really what i want to do if i do not get into medical school am sure there are many possibilities with a psychology major i can go to graduate school and such and maybe be come a psychologist i think that would be more fun and interesting gosh all am thinking about now is how hungry i am , ha ha i did not eat any breakfast this morning even though i have lots of junk food in the dorm room , that i can eat i will wait another hour or so to go have lunch with my roommate my next class is not until 1230 so i have plenty of time until then i am going to study some more for my quiz on tomorrow and maybe i will eat something to before lunch , because right now i am way too hungry i am glad i have some food in here its not healthy but i am just way too hungry i want to take a nap too , but am not going to i will try to go to bed early tonight maybe well see how long it will take to finish up at the learning center hopefully i can be done by 9 or 930 i am going to leave the dorm around 630 or so , so i can be at jester by 7 i want to finish my calculus homework so i wont have to worry about it that much i already got enough stuff to worry about and do i just want tomorrow to be over with after tomorrow 's quiz i think i will be okay

2004_13.txt 0 0 1 0 0 it 's amazing how much free time you have in college a totally different experience from when i was in my grade school years grade school , seems like i was in the 5th grade it 's hard to believe that my high school years were actually my grade school years as well and now i'm in a place of 60 , 000 people where you are lucky if 50 people know who you are but with all this free time , it 's hard to fill it with stuff to do all the time naps are a great way of filling up lots of hours , but you can only sleep so much i remember laying in bed last night and having a feeling of homesickness even though i only live 20 minutes away and can go home with the push of seven digits i feel bad for the people who are from small towns a million miles away not only are they far from home , but being thrown into the fire that is ut and surviving is a difficult task for anyone , let alone coming from towns 1 30 the size of ut but i have been enjoying my college experience so far being able to sleep late , wake up late , take 3 hour naps , all of it not having to sit in a classroom for an hour and half every other day is a major plus as well come to think of it , i have no idea how i sat through those days and actually was focused for its entirety the xbox is calling my name as i write , taunting me with glimpses of football and shooting it 's amazing how people think that video games are responsible for their child being violent and whatnot parents are blaming a series of circuits and programs as the reason their kid is messed up if people were being better parents , these kids would have better things to do than rot their brains in front of a tv screen in today 's world of money money and more money , it 's hard to find time to put aside what is quite important in the world and spending time with the people that matter most not that tv 's bad heck , i watch way too much of it myself , but my parents also ingrained in me the difference between right and wrong and i was lucky enough to be born right before the start of the technological age , so i get the best of what the world has to offered right now but had my values and beliefs ingrained in me before this ever growingly corrupt world took over growingly , is that a word it 's hard to write for twenty minutes straight without going off on a tangent and starting to focus on other things , like the schlotsky 's cup sitting in front of my desk that 's been sitting there for a few days and is probably starting to be a safe haven for mold speaking of which , there is also a box of fajita toppings that have been sitting in our refrigerator since school started , and yet even though i remember , i still do not get off my butt and throw it out i keep telling myself that i will do it when i actually take out the trash but heck , we only take the trash out like , once a week i remember doing a stream of consciousness writing as one of my creative works in high school for a book we read because i thought that stream of consciousness writings would be really simple heck , you just write whatever comes to your head not too hard right but man , i think i have grown up in a very rigidly structured school system and always have to plan stuff out before i actually start writing so i found myself doing more thinking than writing , trying to find the right words and grammar usages so that my paper would not sound like a first grader wrote it but sometimes that 's what a stream of consciousness writing has to be it does not matter if you use fifty letter words or big , because these writings are not about the content , they are about collecting your thoughts and putting them down no matter how random they be i found it funny how when you gave out this assignment and asked if there were any questions , 20 hands shot up in the air questions arose like , how many paragraphs how many words what 's the structure we grow up in a world of rules , where everything is set out before us and we either follow or be considered a problem child we spend more time defining the box rather than thinking outside it heck , we rarely even spend time thinking inside of it my dad 's friend is starting this school in which they let kids pretty much do whatever they want they provide guidance but not rules , set boundaries but do not fence the kids in their objective is to let the kid develop his or her own self discipline , not letting some adult develop it for him or her so that when they get out into the real world , they do not curl up into a little ball and hide or rebel and go crazy and not know what they are doing while i think it 's a pretty cool idea , others reject the fact that a school like this exists because people are ingrained with rules , their lives governed by the boundaries of the box so hopefully , someday , people will be able to think for themselves , that we wo not become robots that only exist because god told us we could exist at the time that we do exist
2004_15.txt 1 0 1 1 0 today has not been a very good day for me i found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex boyfriend behind my back my friend and i caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm this is one of the worst feeling i have ever felt i am dating a boy right now , but the feelings for my ex have started to resurface she fully knows that i like him , but she is deceiving me i was very irritable today and i was rude to a lot of people i really am not a rude person , i just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness i went to pappasito 's last night to pick up some to go food it is sitting in my refrigerator and i am very anxious to eat it i already had some chips , salsa , queso , and guacamole today i love mexican food i have a french test tomorrow this is our second test i thought i made an a on the last test , but when i got it back i found a much lower grade it upset me , so i am going to study very hard for this test right now i have a 4 0 at the university , and i want to keep it as close to that as possible i have noticed while typing this that i never capitalize 'i' i have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times i am used to typing informally online , where grammar and capitalization does not matter my roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting , and i wanted to go read some of her aim logs so , i walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and i thought i heard her key in the door i was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me from that experience i have realized that i do not want to be snooping in her stuff anymore it would not be worth it if she came in and caught me we already are going to be on semi bad terms after i talk to her tonight about chris one of our good friends thinks that once i talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing he said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was too good to be true oh come on she met him like three days ago , there is no way she likes him that much it just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship and goes after something that she knows will hurt me last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her she told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because chris is special that is what got to me the most she is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 3 days ago i am already stressed out enough with school , i do not need roommate problems this is the reason i do not hang out with girls , they do this sort of thing to each other my guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this when they try to get to me , they use force like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows it got frustrating , but i did not get emotionally hurt by it girls get you in the worst possible way tonight mean girls is showing at the union i want to go see it so bad because i love that movie it is so good i would go see it if i did not have to do all of this homework i already had a test last week in french , i am upset that there is another one this week our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test it is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test , so there is no need to assign homework oh well i have not done laundry since i arrived here in austin i am down to my last pants and shorts i will probably do some tonight , if i do not get too lazy i have treated this writing assignment as like a journal i have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing , so it is good that i could write it all out it has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly my hand are getting kind of numb i think it is because i never use the shift key to capitalize things , and now i have to well , my time has come to an end time to get back to more homework
2004_16.txt 0 1 1 0 1 hey you , so far so good , i have got chem done and do not have to worry about this when i finish typing wish i could type faster , without the errors too , that would be great like tony the tiger anyways , i'm happy as of the moment i get to see anthony today , and any day that that happens is a good day for me ( at least , most of the time ) ) i like rings , that was the only thing i could think of sometimes when i write , ( normally i write letters notes to people ) in this stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell ) type of writing but sometimes i try to be random and that just is not fair to anyone i do not like this delete button , ( i just do not like the fact i have to use it so much ) anyways i have been waking up on time so far what has it been , 5 days dear me , i will never keep it up , being such not a morning person and all but maybe i will adjust , or not i want internet access in my room , i do not ' have it yet , but i will on wed i think but that ai not soon enough , cause i got calculus homework due by then , and i hate using the library computers or jackie 's she 's such a good friend , what would i ever do without her no one knows not even me , or you , whoever you are sorry i'm not interesting today , must have picked a bad day the phrase academics first just seems to be such a lie cause everywhere you go , it seems that athletics is first or at least that 's how it is in high school where you are ap physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 1 class every week , ( and you only have 2 or 3 classes a week to begin with ) anyways it 's a pet peeve of mine what others do i have i'm not sure at the moment , i'm not sure about a lot of things though anthony is always saying you do not ' know a lot do you and it 's true , cause when i do not ' know , i do not know , and i admit it i wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday i always wanted to see if i could beat one but i ca not lie very well to begin with ca not lie to mom , jackie , and anthony but everyone else i can pass a few things by by the way , ( there 's is nothing to add on to that , it was just what i thought ) that 's what you get when you assign this type of assignment but i'm not complaining , i really enjoy it it lets me think cause when i think in my head , it does not ' really work , i still do not know what i'm thinking but when i write it , then i can at least see what i'm trying to think my finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing i must sound like a hick when i talk type but that 's okay , cause i'm texan and if that 's what it takes to be texan , then so be it damn do not ' i sound spiffy ( not really ) do not ' know why people ( anthony ) hates texas so much i mean , common on ! it do not ever get cold that 's the best part ( well it does sometimes , but not as much as other places ) finish i type what i read , and then go from there can you find the finish button oh , yesterday i had the overbearing urge to watch the fox and the hound why i do not ' know do not ' care to much either hi i'm copper ! i'm todd one d or two i do not ' know do not ' think i care too much either about that what do i care about ca not think of anything at the moment , but i'm sure there is something anthony , grades ( anthony 's my boy friend by the way ) look , there 's that phrase , by the way' again btw blah that always reminds me of jackie , ( my friend , happy pr chick ) blah does she says it a lot , and now i'm saying it a little more hmmm 2 mins ! the brisket will be ready in 1 hour ! sorry that commercial always pops up in my head when i start counting down down the hill , over the hill where 's grandmother who knows i guess i do not do you good question bye for now , farewell godspeed choa ! bye me oh i did not know that we could keep going after the ending i was all prepared to stop and all well i would keep writing , but i'm sure i have stuff to do , and this ai not ever going to be read anyways so adios amigos ! me man , i type slow
2004_18.txt 0 0 1 0 1 well , i'm 18 years old now and i'm in college so far it has been kind of boring really and i still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything ok not everything but it 's not a good thing and wow 20 minutes is a long time i want to watch this show on television but i guess i wo not so let 's see what else i am thinking the dryer is kind of loud and only 2 minutes have passed since i have been typing nonsense school is also exhausting i take naps like everyday and you know i actually like writing about nothing because why hmm well , because i'm not stuck with a certain topic and i just have to decide what to write about i would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense however , about 1 hour ago i was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now i'm hungry again because i did not have much to eat so i'm thinking of going to starbucks and getting some delicious mocha frappucino is that spelt with 1 or 2 c 's anyways before i go to starbucks i may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at ut because i may still have other assignments to attend to and ut is too far of a distance man i wonder what time starbucks is closed i also want some ice cream i sure hope that i do not gain the freshman 15 because that would really suck i hope that does not offend whomever has to read this because i did not mean to i sure hope that i learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually my throat or something hurts and i wish that i could just sleep all day i hate some of my classes and i hate being in the gateway program it 's alright but not what i expected i definitely did not expect to take a class for that program but i am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms i feel like what am i doing there and can i get out of the program without hurting the coordinator also , when should i try to get out of the program 6 more minutes to go what to talk about what to talk about oh yeah , i had a fever last week and i hope that i do not get sick again this year another thing about the gateway program is that i have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life i definitely do not know what to do they like helped me register or whatever and i have to wait 3 hours and 30 minutes on mwf before my last class on those days which is psychology and i have no idea what to do during that time and i tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class sorry 2 more minutes i'm looking at this sheet and i have no idea what to do with my ut email address and how to get into it does that make me dumb i wonder if i'm even going to get a response for that question yeah 9 more seconds
2004_21.txt 1 1 0 0 0 well its sunday night and i'm just chilling in the room i'm enjoying not having my roommate here it is so nice to just do whatever without someone here talking and making noise and talking to everyone under the sun on the phone that 's what my roommate does instead of going out like a normal college student she sits in the room and talks to her parents like a million times a day i guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever i want then we have no problems last night was pretty fun i went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience i kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he was not that good of a dancer because he could not keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways the funnest was on friday when me and kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that i met at camp texas he was a counselor that i had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever i really did not think anything of it at the time because i thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so i kind of kept my distance i e mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me he did , which was good i was hoping he would i think i kind of like him but i have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so i'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it and plus he is the guy and i grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so i'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started maybe that 's my problem when i want something i tend to let it come to me and i just wait around till something happens maybe i should go after the things i want speaking of things that i want , i applied to be a texas lasso i got a call back today saying that they wanted me to come in for an interview i was so excited i have wanted to join something like this ever since i got to campus they do everything , from socials to community service i heard about it from the guy that invited me to the iron spikes party this past friday he is an iron spike and he suggested i look into it because he thought i would enjoy it and the lassos do social events and stuff with them so maybe i could be able to hang out with joe a little more but whatever about that i really hope i get in to this because i really want to be apart of something and have those group of friends that are in the same position as me that i can always count on to be around for me to go out with and things like that i have been recently hanging out with kayla who is one of the girls i met at orientation we do everything together and she just got into longhorn singers so that pretty much takes up all her social time now that 's why i want to get involved in something of my own so i wont have to sit around my room waiting for a time when she can do stuff with me that 's not what college is all about its about having fun and enjoying yourself , not sitting around your room all day and only coming out for food or class like my roommate she is trying to get involved though she signed up for the rowing team so we will see how that works out it seems kind of weird to me but whatever floats her boat i'm no one to judge i have got the music on my computer going and the tv so there is all kinds of stuff to keep me occupied while i sit here and type for twenty minutes i have like five minutes left so that 's good because i'm kind of getting tired of typing tomorrow me , kayla , and her roommate sheik are going shopping at barton creek mall ! i am very excited about that because i love to shop and i want some big sunglasses i have seen lots around campus and i want some of my own i really do not want anything else but u never know once you get going i'm a big shoe fanatic so hopefully no shoes will impress me because i will buy them and add to the collection in my room its going to be fun whether i get stuff or not because i just love shopping in general that 's why my major is retail merchandising i will get to shop for a major company like mace 's or nordstrom or even tiffany 's that is my dream i want to have a base office in new york city and then travel all over buying merchandise for my company i want to eventually be head person because i do not like being under someone else 's control but i know ill have to start from the bottom which is fine but u better believe i will work my butt off to fulfill my goals and dreams my parents have been wanting me to come home for a weekend but i think not yet i do not want to miss anything up here it is so much fun at college !
2004_22.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i just read in alfred adler 's understanding human nature that a person 's psyche and action is driven by an ultimate goal , and that that goal is irreversibly influenced by experiences , emotions , failures , and other memories from childhood and i consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child now , i feel the only way i can attain happiness is to create something to form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul i need to see my doubt , anger , passion , fear , fascination , and every substance of my mind materialize now , in this search to form and mold the outer world , i turn to literature , to books and stories of others , tales with which i can empathize and understand my hunger for reading is insatiable everything from novels , to scientific articles , to textbooks , to philosophical papers , i want it all i want to absorb it so that i do not miss an ounce of life i want to share every shape and substance of time , to reflect on all thoughts before me so that i can mold those after and in all of this , with all the knowledge , as i absorb the mind of others through their literary creations , i feel great anxiety in that i have not made a contribution of my own many projects that i saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short my passions flow like a liquid , undulating and turning over , never constant , never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment several novels begun on my own , yet my mind drifts to other settings , other plots and themes , other characters and personalities i can never immerse myself in the fictitious , because my own thoughts are unstable the worlds i put on paper dissolve , evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness i am always looking forward to what i will be , what i could possibly become , my intellect , my insight , my ambition , the materialization of all my passions and it fills me with great anxiety , dread that the person inside of my my never emerge and i think back to my early life my parents childhood when everything rested on today , on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores , on that tv show that i have waited for all night these were simple pleasures , now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation it makes me so tired to look forward to never be now my parents were demanding good grades , a clean room , church attendance , moral infallibility always left behind in someone 's expectations enslaved to your own dedication and attachment i loved them then cherished them everything i did was to attain their approval then i would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment an ovation of some sort i need approval i still do my father was a loner , and now i am a hermit as well he never shared his thoughts compassion , empathy , conversation , all foreign in the house i made up games to express myself my imagination was as abundant as the grown up books i read the stuff everyone else hated the big thick books on science , philosophy and religion when people were still learning their multiplication tables science fiction fantasy anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable and i wanted to escape straight a 's , top of all my classes , and only a pat on the back still not good enough , because no one would share it they wanted to play outside , go to the bayou , ride bikes , play in puddles , watch a movie , go to a party , raise hell i just wanted to be alone with my books my imagination and i have never had a close friend , because i was always so afraid of betrayal so afraid that i would be cast out , and many times i was , when i just wanted to think now i do not know if there is much else than my own thoughts , and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head i hope for someone who can share my mind someone who can relate to life , looking back on it , reflecting , not just living it
2004_23.txt 1 0 0 1 1 right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes but i will definitely need to leave in around thirty that boy michael was really cute really cute he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself that 's one of the things i do not like about this school no one introduces themselves to each other it 's like everyone only cares about their own lives and wo not be bothered by anyone else 's but you know what i think everyone else wants to meet people too , at least the majority but they just do not know how to go about doing it so they act like they do not care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else it 's very sad i think at the beginning everyone is all excited , expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person , they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral just because we all fear a little bit of rejection sad really that was my friend matt from economics class he 's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet i'm going to be so behind in economics i tell you i really like that class though so anyways i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few a very few whatever i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people ugh i just put so anyways instead of so anyway i think that sounds as dumb as laters when one really means later that is really very jr high i miss those days i wonder how cindy is doing ugh i really do not want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart damn that sounds really conceited maybe i'm a little of that too i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that 's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself it 's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself it 's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it within reason that is so anyway i am these things but i feel like people do not want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted i know they will like me if they get to know me but it 's that introducing part that is really limiting kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely i am so proud of myself lately i am being such a good girl although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today 's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy 's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp when they are unimportant i'm really irritated by that but back to the story i have been developing such good habits i make my bed everyday , i wash my face twice a day , i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early o shit i just got a little flash of procrastination that sneaky devil no go away ! ! ! i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year i just do not have the time for that i run every day mon thurs 2 miles a day plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that 's always nice kind of a motivating factor when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up damn that dinner ugh what else do i do o yea i did not even go out last weekend and i had no desire too i have not been drinking i have not been too flakey with the exception of ross but that 's quite not my fault most of the time anyway we are good terms at the present i'm being a pretty good daughter i finished my scholarship applications stuff what to write about now i want to write about something cool no luck i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes bad flutes in lol i'm probably really bad by now i wonder if there is practice rooms around i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here i thought they would be all confident and just come up to you and then i would act all shy and innocent it 's just how i act natural reflex to wanted attention sometimes i think i'm so stupid and then they would flatter me and ask me out and i would act like i was not really sure i little bit suspicious of their motives ( and rightly so i imagine ) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away see yaw this has been a pleasant venting experience i tell you
2004_24.txt 0 0 1 1 1 i really need to study for chemistry , but i just remembered that this assignment was due i would have done it earlier , but my computer has been giving me so many problems first all these warnings about you have spyware and adware started coming up and then it started working really slow it took 15 minutes to open up the internet ! ! then after a while it would not even do that it just sat there ! so i tried to shut it down and it still did not do anything but if i tried to start a program , it said this program cannot open because the system is shutting down so i unplugged it and let the battery run out computers are so stupid but i guess we could not live without them i really hope i do not fail this chemistry test tomorrow i'm really nervous because it 's my first real college test and it 's also over some stuff that i do not completely understand my roommate is in the same class as me , but she 's at the pcl she calls it her home because she 's there every minute of every day i do not know how she does it ! ! studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like i need a break she stays there for hours ! ! she 's really sweet though i so happy i got good roommates ( yes that 's plural i have 3 roommates i'm in supplemental housing it 's not as bad as i thought it would be ) 2 of my roommates are really nice the other one is kind of weird , but she 's hardly ever here she 's always at her boyfriend 's house that 's kind of rude to her parents though i mean they are paying for her food and housing and she 's not even sleeping here the only thing i know about her is her name really that 's okay though at least she 's not using my computer all the time anymore when we first moved in she did not have a ethernet cord so i said she could do her add drops on my pc but then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes ( on my printer with my ink ) so at least that 's not happening any more andy roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the us open tonight that made me so sad i love andy roddick he has to be the sexiest guy ever ! i met him last year and the tennis masters series in houston and he signed my shirt me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled out andy he and his coach really liked them ! ! but i really wanted him to win he won the open last year and that was his first so i really wanted him to defend it oh well the guy he lost to was playing really good he played the same type of game as andy though they were calling him a swedish andy roddick , but he will never be andy roddick he was not cute enough chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester i'm not really sure if i want to major in biology any more i think it might just be too much science for me i thought i could handle it , but i just do not know anymore i know majoring in biology will probably help me make a good score on the mcat , though i really want to get into med school i want to be a pediatrician it 's just so much school though oy ! but i think it will pay off i really want to do something with kids and i could do that and make money at the same time i mean it 's that or teaching right and teaching is definitely not on my list of things i want to do my mom is a teacher and they do not get paid half of what they deserve ! she works all the time sometimes she does not come home until after midnight and she only works with 5th and 6th graders i mean it 's probably worse with older kids right i do not know i just could not handle it i would feel like i deserved more chemistry time
2004_25.txt 0 1 1 0 0 wow , its the end of another week , and finally i get time to relax my idea of relaxing is not partying or drinking my idea of relaxing is sleeping yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind , is my favorite hobby my roommate is reading what i'm reading so i had to halt before i continued typing there 's another friend in my room and he 's laughing at what i just wrote he should not be reading other people 's thoughts ! wow 3 minutes over already i got 17 minutes left i'm just feeling really light right now light in the head i ca not think of anything to write this is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment it 's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again tomorrow 's saturday and saturday means another football game for ut i could not go for the first game , because i did not have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package my roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now so basically i'm doing two things at a time typing and listening to music some people can study with music playing , i still have not tried studying with music playing in the background maybe i should try it out sometime i think it is important to knock before you enter a room but that just does not happen in jester one of my friends just barged in , and i jumped in my seat this is crazy i should tell him not to do that again i'm not that fastidious actually but certain things annoy me the things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being , so i know i'm not a freak i have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week 's events it 's been a great week my chemistry test went well i really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester , so i can get some kind of scholarship i do not want my father to pay so much for my education he does not grumble or anything , but i just feel guilty i know that i have to work extra hard because i have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like stand i must make good use of this advantage i have over other people i'm loving it here i came to america exactly a month ago wow i should be celebrating today it 's been a month in the united states this stupid friend is irritating me , wish i could ask him to leave , i ca not concentrate on my thoughts he 's asking me why i type with just two fingers god i'm going to tell him to mind his own business i better change the topic or he might read this , and get annoyed and abuse me or something yeah but making friends has been tough i have not made too many friends my roommate is my best friend as of now i could not have asked for a better roommate we just get along really well today at chemistry class i met another indian girl she was from houston she was basically an abcd american born confused desk desk refers to indians ok my 20 minutes are up so i'm going to sign off now i'm going shopping with my friend rashmi , right now i'm going to the target store then i have got to come back and do my laundry ok i'm going bye writing this assignment has been great thank you
2004_26.txt 0 0 0 0 1 well , i suppose i should think of a topic to write for 20 minutes it is a mystery to what kind of issue or topic the professor wishes me to explore i know he says to just type what i think , but the topic is so broad there are an infinite number of paths and possibilities to explore what exactly is the professor trying to look for in this writing experiment it ca not be the simple fact to see if a person is capable of typing for 20 minutes my mind currently draws a blank at what i should write about perhaps my first impressions of college as a freshman well so far , i think i'm still getting used to the fact that i am living on my own , and i do have a greater sense of independence from my parents however , there are responsibilities i like and dislike having wow , it 's only been around 5 minutes since i started i really doubt i am capable of typing about no specific topic for a whole 20 minutes now i am thinking if i am required to type for the whole 20 minutes , or if i can simply hit the finish button when i have finished this stream of thought earlier , i started to complete a few experiment requirements the prescreening requirement was not available , which is kind of depressing since it seemed like an easy 1 5 hr worth of experimental credit i hope it becomes available later now , my mind continues to draw a blank with nothing to write about honestly , i'm watching tv while typing this assignment , hoping to pass the time a little faster it does not seem to be helping much though it 's strange when you try to force yourself to type about anything , nothing comes out not just nothing good , but absolutely nothing ! well i'm nearing the 15 min mark , and i seem to have less and less to write i wonder how long other people 's assignments will be perhaps most will be longer than mine , but maybe not some soul must be just as stuck as i am

2004_28.txt 0 1 0 1 1 hi , i'm sitting here in the computer lab at the fac , and it is dark outside and i'm a young attractive female i will definitely need an escort when it 's time to go home home , that 's what i call my dorm these days it 's just easier for me i want to have some established place to live and stuff that way i will be more plugged in to the university lifestyle i used to laugh at lt when she called her dorm home i guess i am following in her footsteps although her strides are quite different from mine and talking of strides , i miss cross country and all the guys it was so much fun i enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it i wish i could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice , so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should what went up came down and so on i wish i could just see the fruit of my hard work as i did in cross country the family atmosphere that i ridiculed and even took for granted at times how could i have been so i who loves others , i who cherishes all my friends they were all my friends , all 23 of them some more than others , but we all had that common goal that i find characterizes friendships we were a sister hood gosh , what a mourner i am , lamenting over the past but they were good times i'm sure , and i hope to god that i will have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come but this i can only hope that god gives me for who knows tomorrow may never be perhaps this is all i have i'm not afraid though , just not prepared to meet my maker yet i do not think i have done what i was purposed to do therefore i'm not ready to go yet in fact , , , i do not even know what it is that i was purposed to do perhaps it is not a single great thing , perhaps it is just all those little things that i should be doing that i was purposed to do who knows who cares but me and my maker anyway , i guess that 's life , not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it i guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do i do not think planning is such a great idea i do not think mlk planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college i guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader or so i guess and whatever it is that i will need to do will find me and use me for what i am worth when put that way , it sounds almost prostitution but it cannot be mankind is not a prostitute race or is it i do not know sometimes i think it is other times i think it is a dignified race but then again to think mankind a dignified race is to give it too much adoration too much more than it deserves mankind is a fallen race lower than the angles which we should have been higher than but then again mankind is a dignified race made in the image of god with the ability to tap into the supernatural the unknown unlike any other creature there is no intelligent life in other planets , we are it now , i do not mean to say there is no other life forms out there , but that it is not more intelligent or even as intelligent as mankind but then again what do i know i who was born only 18 years ago i do not know much , but then again , i have know a lot more than i credit myself i have the ability to tap into the fountain of knowledge that never runs dry there are things , great mysteries , that i knew even before i was born but how is this oops my 20 minutes are up and that popup really disrupted my stream of consciousness ! ! ! ! what an ass !

2004_33.txt 0 0 0 0 0 i'm still trying to figure out why i always procrastinate i think i like to work under pressure , i have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours i wonder if this class is going to be hard , or easy as long as you read and listen i hope the second because i have never been one to study , and i would prefer not to now why do people go home on the weekends i thought that was what college is all about , going out on your own , more independence calculus is going to be difficult this semester , i can already tell i'm going to have to do the homework in there microecon should not be too bad , i already covered most of the material in high school if there 's one thing in life i want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think , and what they mean by what they say or by their actions i'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit its like you could be best friends , always hanging out have a great time , and think there 's something there , but she just is gone for a while then i'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing i read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours after that everyone he saw he thought was satan or the grim reaper or something like that i think that would be an interesting experience to have , hallenacion and what not i hope bush wins the election , although my family is die hard republican , i am more agree with things from both sides , with a slight lean to republican i just believe bush will do a lot better job than kerry , and the whole vietnam thing i just do not was right its funny how people can overreact and stereotype there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service while i do not know everything about it , i was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats and the people i heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it i just hate it when people do not get their facts straight before they try and argue things , it just makes them look stupid poker is a fun little game i wish i could play it more often trying to read people , and make decisions based on their actions and words i wish i could find a girlfriend there are many beautiful girls down here , but i do not know about some of them there was this awesome beautiful girl at home , but i do not really know what happened there , i guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman 's brain i realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is , or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because i am thinking about how long it is , or i'm not doing an activity i find to be exciting figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity its hard because some people listen to all types of music coffee is a life saver , going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun , i'm surprised i woke up for it i missed class the other day when i slept through it and it was at 12 that 's just strange , getting up at the 8 one , but oversleeping the 12 i wonder what the real world has in store for me , no more school and someone there to help but as one professor i met said , remember these days , these are heaven because after school you are going into hell which i would agree with although i have not experienced life after school , but i think it will be hell
2004_34.txt 0 0 1 1 1 there 's a picture of the two of us up on my bulletin board it 's right behind my computer where i can see it when i'm working i look at that picture and remember my past i remember a time when i thought that things were different than they really are i do not think anymore that it was anyone 's fault , either hers or mine , that is i respected her so much though , and it hurts to be let down by someone you think so highly of in the picture , i look so innocent and young , in my white cheerleading skirt , and the royal blue shell with eagles written across it her arm is around my shoulder , and she 's holding her sunglasses in her hand i recall that she had just taken them off before we took the picture there are people in the background behind us , and the gym is visible i remember how beautiful the day was it was so crisp and blue and wonderful it 's hard to tell , and i have wondered many times , what exactly she was thinking when we took that picture together when i look at the face , the eyes especially , sometimes i see something warm and trustworthy other times i'm sure i see something sinister and strange i do not know why i still struggle with this issue so much i have never really gotten over it i went into this assignment knowing that i wanted to write about carla because in class , i heard something said about how writing about something can change your opinion or the way you look at something well , it is true that i'm noticing things about the picture , minute details , that i did not pay too much attention to before but her face and her eyes are still an enigma to me i ca not explain in words how much i want her to care about me , to love me , and to think i'm something special i want to tell her everything that i have done today and yesterday and since i arrived here but she 's back home , and i'm here , and there 's something ominous to me about writing her an email i do not know why i miss her so much she was there when i really needed someone i see now more and more , that this was mostly situational it 's not like she planned to be in that room when my whole world fell apart but she was and she told me how to get through it , and she cared more than any person has ever cared about me on this earth , at least that i'm aware of the picture is truly beautiful , even though it 's more than 5 years old the light is in our hair , coming from behind , and our faces are bright and illuminated the beauty of the day is apparent i just feel like something needs to happen between us there was never any closure for me , or continuation our relationship just sort of drifted off and never returned , and now i do not know where we are i saw her by chance before i left for college at church because we are making a new church pictorial , and her family happened to be getting their pictures done on the same night as our family i was very surprised to see her , and i know my heart skipped a beat i had not seen her in such a long time probably since before school let out for the summer the truth is , i was a little bit upset with her for not being around but she was nothing but warm and kind to me i do not know why she always does that i see her , and it 's like i'm the whole world but then when we are apart , i do not hear a peep i do not understand our relationship sometimes , and it 's very hurtful to me to analyze her possible motives anyway , she hugged me , and touched me , and stood close to me , and made me promise to keep in touch when i'm gone she even promised to make me some chili or something when i come back and come over to her house i fear that that 's an empty promise , like so many of the others but at the time , it was easy to believe her i really think it 's something to do with her eyes you have never seen anyone with such power behind their gaze she is so earnest with her eyes , but so untruthful with her actions it confuses me to no end i do not even know why i brought the picture with me , or why i decided to place it in such an obvious place where i can always see it but i did i guess my hopes die hard i still hope that maybe she really does care about me maybe she really does think i'm special maybe , she does even really love me i do not know what to believe i think maybe this evening when i have some time to myself , i will write her that email that i have been meaning to i think maybe i could even get up the courage to be totally honest with her , and get everything out in the open well , maybe that 's a little too unrealistic , but maybe i can begin to open it up for discussion i think it would be very good for me to do so i want to know what 's really behind those eyes i have got to know about the truth i really desire to understand the enigma my dear carla
2004_35.txt 1 0 1 1 0 here i sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness , which should not be too hard writing for me is usually pretty easy , however this assignment seems to be particularly hard maybe because i feel partially tired and torn down from my long day i am looking forward to tomorrow because thursdays are probably my easiest days because i will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend ! although i have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am , which was time i had to arrive at school during my high school days since high school just popped into my mind , i have to say that college is a major leap from high school despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful for instance , leaving your family , friends , and so forth behind not to mention your adolescence i am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come one of my bumps that i am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved , at one point i enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not , in fact it is just another realization that i am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices i find that very scary , yet also very exciting in a positive way because i can make my future what i want it to be
2004_36.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i am sitting in my room watching the sandlot alessandra , my roommate is here too she 's getting ready to go home for the weekend shelley and liz are both going home to they offered me a ride , but i'm not going to go because i went home last weekend , and i do not want to go home two weekends in a row although i would really like to see jordan , my boyfriend he 's at work right now and i'm waiting for him to call the sandlot is on the part where benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard i have seen this movie a thousand times , the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town this is probably one of my favorite baseball movies my favorite of all time is definitely field of dreams i always cry in the end where kevin costner 's character plays catch with his dad they did not get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died my dad and i have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been , i know that i would regret it if i just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it , so i'm glad we are at least trying to work things out he apologized to jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch i stayed inside and folded laundry because i felt awkward and tense about the whole thing but apparently it went alright i need to talk to my dad and tell him that i appreciate him doing that i forgot to before actually , i just realized now that that 's something i need to do probably should have said it earlier i hope i did not hurt his feelings oh well , like i said , i felt awkward about the whole thing in general which reminds me of a funny awkward moment i had today i was at the union with shelley , and i went to the bathroom another girl was going in just as i was , and this made my shy bladder act up she went into one stall , i went into the other , and i just could not go well , she was not going either , apparently , so we both just sat there for about a minute i was trying hard to relax and finally i peed a little , but then it stopped so the girl pees a little , and i pee a little more , but i still ca not go all the way i guess she gave up , because i heard the toilet flush and she left , so i was finally able to go i went back to shelley and told her the story we were cracking up in the quietness of the union 3rd floor we started talking about alex 's engagement ( again ) , which i feel guilty about because i am usually not the type to gossip , but it 's hard to avoid talking about it before i saw alex 's ring ( which is her grandmothers , joe did not buy it ) , shelley told me that it was 1 7 carats , which is pretty impressive , but then i saw it , and looked at it closely , and it 's not that great its color is not that good , and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which i suppose alex either has not seen or is just pretending that she ca not see it jordan just called and i told him i need to call him back in eight minutes anyway , alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement , wedding thing she wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring , and she 's looking at dresses that are 30 , 000 dollar , designer dresses , and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding she does not seem to realize that the average middle class family ca not afford something like that but who knows , maybe her parents have more money than i think also , i do not know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement she 's only been with joe for about two months i can hardly think about my future with jordan now , and i definitely could not have thought about it after two months the only thing i can say is that if we are still together when i graduate , i will probably marry him but i find myself thinking a lot that i want to be single , and i want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in new york , and if someone is going to hold me back from those things , then i have to wonder if that 's the person from me i love him so much , but i also feel like i might be holding on to him because he 's my first love and all that he 's such a great person though , i hope no matter what happens , that he will always be in my life i just do not want to break his heart , or have my heart broken i hope when it stops working , it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends well , i have ten seconds left , so i think i'm going to call him now

2004_38.txt 0 1 1 1 0 i am sitting in my room and i look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend trying to make my train of thought come to me so i can type it all i can think about is all my boyfriend 's theories about life and his many different issues he believes in boxism , he was a little out of it when he thought of this , were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box , hospital room , which is part of a bigger box , the hospital hall , which is placed into a bigger box , the whole hospital building itself then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box , the crib , which is in a box the room , part of the bigger box the whole house after this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box after we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box my boyfriend 's theory always brings a smile to my face as i remember when he first told me this wow , that only took me ten minutes i look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school , i believe that those are some of the best times in my life my class was very small and we all got to know each other very well i have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school i hope it becomes the best time of my life i have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life i love being able to do whatever i want when i want to i hope these next few years will become the best years of my life
2004_39.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i really enjoy this class i can get into it and not be bored like my other classes the class that i hate the most is my chemistry class because i don't understand the teacher and i sont understand the subject my major is nursing and pre med i really hope i can get into medical school so i can become a surgeon my room just left to her lab class her name is katrina but i call her kat she's so awesome ! ! we bought a fish together on monday his name is senior sol okay ! ! this thing just went back so i clicked forward on the web browser and my information was still here , but my time started over so that sucks ! ! ! i'm kind of watching tv and doing this assignment at the same time , but most of my foucus is going into this i really miss my friends ! ! ! especially the fab five ! ! emily , laura , miguel , aron , and soid ! ! i love them so much ! ! i talked to emily yesterday online and she's rooming with laura at smu and she told me that laura is going greek and is starting to act like a barbie doll ! ! i wonder if as soon as i go home if me and her will still get along ! ! hmm wonders i really have to go to the restroom and i don't think i can really get up and go or if i have to keep writing i really have to go so i'm going to go and i'll be back soon ! ! ! okay i'm back ! i hope that doesn't effect anything but i think it made up for the time that got erased i'm watching who wants to be a millionare now and i wish i could be on that show because i think i would actually make it and because i really want to be on tv and make money as well it's really cold in my dorm room and i'm starting to get sick i really miss my boyfriend right now he's at work though he goes to acc and he's a second year i think if he wasn't here in austin with me i would go crazy because i would be here all alone without friends or family his name is rey and on the 14th its going to be our 2 month anniversary it has been one of my longest relationships my longest relationship would have had to be 6 months and that relationship was off and on there's only one problem with my relationship with rey and that is that my family still doesn't know about him and i think i should tell them soon i really love him a lot ! ! he treats me right and we haven't really gotten into a fight that we don't speak to each other i talk to him everyday and we try to see each other everyday and so far since i've moved here i do see him everyday even if its just for a little while i think that he might be the one he told his family all about me ! ! and so far they approve one of his cousins though said that she is going to throw water balloons at me because she doesn't want him to have a girlfriend i also miss my family a lot but i really don't want to tell them that i miss them because then they'll be like i told u so and i told you that you were going to miss us my mom emails me and calls me everyday even though its not necessary since i haven't lived at home since june since i was attending smu but she just started calling everyday as soon as i moved to austin my little cousin jonathan that i miss the most and i cry each time just thinking about him is upset and crys for me because he didnt want me to move and he never seems to want to talk to me because he wants me to give him a better reason than school for me moving big brother 5 just started and that's a really good program , but a lot of the decisions that are being made in the game dissapoint me because there's a lot of back stabbing going on i really need to read for me class and i need to stop procrastinating i need to get on the ball and start studying other than doing nothing and watching tv and going out i really like ut and i think it's one of the best decisions i've ever made

2004_49.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i thought of a million different ways i would start this , and now i ca not think of any well , one way , actually , was to say that this one time i had a conversation with my teacher about whether people thought in complete sentences or not i told her they did not , but now i think they do that is , unless , they are answering questions in thinking that it 's hot , i do not think , hot i think it 's hot in any case , it 's very cold in my room right now my hands and feet are especially cold i wonder if that 's simply because of the temperature of the room or that stress stuff dr pennebaker was talking about well the temperature used to be just fine , and now it 's cold all of the sudden we have to call those eminence guys they came last week and fixed our toilet in like 10 seconds we did not even see them , we just heard them i was joking with my roommate that god came and fixed our toilet god rocks ha ha i have a black t shirt that says that in white letters it 's my old youth group t shirt i designed it i'm quite proud of that it was cool and promoted god one guy once came up to me and asked me if it was being sarcastic that was not cool he felt bad after asking though , he said he did not mean to be rude i believe him he was a cool guy in several of my classes his name was charlie there was this other guy named charlie , too he worked in the emergency room at the hospital where i used to do my clinical rotations for school he was really cool too actually me and my friend , erin , that got along with him really well kept in touch with him she just saw him recently at the mall with his kids , and he told her some details about a friend of ours that died about three weeks ago he was in the emergency room when it happened she was in a car accident and died almost instantly it was pretty sad , but it did not really affect me personally because she was not that close to me however , my oa during orientation reminded me a lot of her , and that 's kind of eerie i say a guy that was an oa this summer at school last week that guy was the one that stood out the most to me because he was the nicest looking ( not as in attractive , as in sincerely nice ) some people have that effect on me sometimes like recently i went to hawaii and the guy that was the scuba diving instructor was named jimmy jimmy was really cool , and he had that effect on me he just seemed like a sincerely nice guy i will probably remember him for a while i have had several people have that effect on me it 's interesting to meet so many people around the world that are absolutely amazing , and they may not even know it they are absolutely amazing to me , and i do not even know why it 's awesome i wish i could keep in touch with someone halfway across the world for a long time i need to find someone first maybe if i get to study abroad in italy i will find someone to keep in touch with things always seem to get in the way of stuff like that , every day life i guess i do not know what it is i do have this one friend , marcus , i have kept in touch with him for about two years now i met him at a medical program one summer , and we have kept in touch since that summer i did lots of stuff i went to canada for world youth day , and i got to see the pope some people got really emotional about that they were crying and stuff i kind of felt bad because i was not crying , but i know there really is no reason i should feel guilty god did not say , thou shall be overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the pope and come to tears hah it would be kind of funny if it said that in the bible anyway , that summer i also went to ldz that was one of the greatest experiences ever i have stumbled upon a few people here at ut that said , you were governor at ldz , right it 's pretty cool how lives cross there are so many people at ut , who would not you find ha ha the monday before classes started i had an audition to try out for the longhorn singers and we were in this tiny room in the music building , and who should walk in the door but m c hammer himself ! ! hahira it was hilarious ! ! he was apparently showing his daughter around because she wanted to get in choir at ut that 's definitely a story worth telling i did not recognize him i'm to young i guess i always figured m c hammer was white only because i knew vanilla ice was ha ha anyway , this whole time i have been writing i have also been thinking about alex alex ( in one sentence ) is the boy i have been in love with almost my entire life the reason why i have been thinking about him now is because a lot of the times i write anything in journals or about what i'm thinking it 's usually about him i know this is simply stream of consciousness but i guess i ca not just write what i'm thinking without thinking of him recently he wrote me an email after i had not emailed him in a while i was waiting for him to write me it was short and mostly insignificant , but he wrote i just want to be friends , i think i do not know what i want i want to have lots of fun in college i want to experience life , then i can figure out what i want with him it 's probably not even my choice to decided what i want with him anyway , another thing i also always thought about was whether deaf people saw signs in there heads instead of heard words when they were thinking

2004_61.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night i have a lot of reading to catch up on i have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time i would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor that is , if he she is interesting i want to read and understand my psychology book , but for some reason i have not been able to concentrate on it i feel like i am behind in this class for some reason my mom graduated with a degree in psychology she loved it my biology class is my favorite my professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too i wish i knew what i wanted to be i have so many different ideas and i ca not decide right now i talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew i used to be interested in that she also suggested being a doctor i do not know if i can go to school for 8 more years though four more years seems like a lot to me but i know i will do it i just feel weird right now i guess because i am just starting i am 3 and a half hours away from home i like it here but i miss it there i always have a lot on my mind and i think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately eight months ago , 2 days before christmas , my boyfriend of 3 years , phillip , was killed in a car accident i almost did not come to ut because he was supposed to follow me here and live in austin too so we could be together i thought about that a lot the first week i was here it is just really hard this is one of the reasons i am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology i have been doing homework all week making up for last week when it comes to school work i love being ahead which is why i am doing this writing assignment a week in advance i'm hoping that i will feel better when i finish this and i will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it when i stay ahead in school i always feel so much better i like to read the sections before lectures rather than after i am the type of person that takes on big load and i tend to get stressed out easy that way i decided that when i came here i was strictly going to concentrate on school in high school i had a full schedule of ap classes , a job , and participated in athletics i loved all of it but i decided i need a break from every thing else which is why i'm not working this semester i worked 6 days a week this past summer to save up for spending money this year so that i would not have to worry about working my parents are paying for my school and all my bills , even my gas so i do not ever want to ask them for spending money i received some scholarship money from dobie , ut from my home town we have community scholarship that they give out every year there was a scholarship made in phillips name this year i got that one that made me feel good i guess i like being here but it is just really weird i hope i adjust to austin soon i already like it a lot better than when i first move here 2 weeks ago my best friend stephanie helped me move down here and it was hard when she had to go back home , but i am going to see here this weekend so that makes me happy
2004_62.txt 0 0 0 1 0 i feel that i have so much to do in the next few days college is so overrated the few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time , or do whatever it is that you like doing , equal all the other times you are reading , reading , studying , or doing other school stuff i had a french vanilla cappuccino at like 9 30 tonight and it gave me so much energy that i ca not sit and focus on one thing it seems that i have been procrastinating all night oooh all that i need is you ( so the song i am listening to right now ) but anyways now i do not remember what i was thinking about a moment ago it must be that caffeine i'm not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last 48 hours o no i'm not really sure what i just did i hit tab because that 's what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead so instead of having a stream of conscious thought for 20 minutes i think it was more like 2 so now i'm thinking about how i need to get in contact with the ta or the professor and explain how i will probably have two submissions but i'm not really sure because i do not know how computers work they are so complex i do not really understand them like earlier i could not log into the prescreening experimental stuff i have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because i do not really trust them i'm very skeptical of them i feel like if i start something the computer has a mind of its own and is going to do whatever with it like just now , i'm panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise the song i'm listening to is sung by a different group , but the same song i did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing during a heavy practice time i had mono i remember kind of a cool time because i got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work was not fun but i did get to know my teachers well that year i wonder how the other two girls that i did the trio with are doing they are both a year older than me so they have been doing this whole college thing longer speaking of long i just looked at the time and i have only been doing this for like five minutes looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever i made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it did not i actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend she is a choreographer for a dance team i was interested in trying out for , but i decided not too because it brought back to many memories i am thinking about trying out for steel dance this weekend but i do not know yet o yaw that reminds me that i need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because i really do not want to wear pink tights and a black leotard it makes me feel fat which reminds me i never ate dinner tonight and its like 110 i guess all the julius chips and salsa i ate will have to do thank goodness for julio he makes some awesome chips i wonder who julio is or even if julio is still alive my roommate brought his chips back from del rio my hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories i think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so i definitely will remember that one o look more remember things i guess the hippo thing is working right now the song i'm listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team rachel and shea they were awesome dancers i wonder where they are now there is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks actually shea has a pair of my comfy pants that i loved that my friend brittney had on tonight shea is in utah so i do not think i will ever see them again speaking of comfy clothes i wonder why all i wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t shirt it must be that whole college thing o no here goes again that whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when i did not even click on the program this computer is so random maybe i just need to update the aim program but then again i do not know that much about computers so i'm not really sure how i would go about doing that with my luck i would probably download some computer virus with it too and viruses that thing about getting sick when you are most stressed i will probably be getting sick soon because i am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project which did not go exactly how i hoped but its over so i do not want to think about it if i say i am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make itself sick that is something else we learned about if you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it o man i do not remember the name of it i am really going to have to study for this test i should probably start this weekend well there is one more thing to add to my to do list i started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer i need to add that i need to talk to a ta for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before i forget my 20 minutes is up now its a good thing i ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most

2004_64.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i just got back from the university democrats meeting it was really fun and informative lloyd doggett was the guest speaker he was very eloquent and well versed , and he did an excellent job stating what he stood for and how the current gerrymandering is unfair , but we are not going to let it stop the party from victory i hope to get really involved with it it seems like a great way to get to know people and learn a lot about the political system at the same time other than university democrat , i'm going to try to join ubc , undergraduate business council you have to fill out an application to become an at large member the questions appeal to the creative side in applicant , so i hope that my creativity steps up to the plate i think that ubc would also be a great way to meet people , especially since it 's for students in the business school i also want to join student government i think that some of the causes that they fight for are so worthwhile , like trying to extend the hours of the library student council in high school did not really accomplish that much , but i think that student government actually gets things done here i'm listening to the shins right now , they are a really good band i love the melodies and guitar other bands that i like include bright eyes , death cab for cutie , the sounds , belle and sebastian , the strokes , and so much more basically anyone on saddle creek records tends to be really good because they all sound so different i have not really been able to find out about new music lately though because i have been sort of busy i'm taking 14 hours , and my classes are statistics , latin 506 , psych , and microeconomics they are all pretty good so far , all my professors are pretty nice i have had a lot of reading to do , and i have been pretty much doing my best to do it all i'm waiting for a couple of books to come in i'm waiting for my microeconomics book and a latin book to come in i really wanted to take intro to political philosophy instead of latin , but oh well i'm thinking about doing international business , and latin is the basis of all the romance languages , so i hope it will help me with other languages international business seems to be like an interesting major , but i still do not know what i want to do i'm probably doing pre med as well , and i also want to take some rtf classes i do not think that you can take rtf classes without majoring in it though , so i'm going to have to apply to that college , i guess i hope i figure out what i want to do because international business , pre med , and rtf are pretty hard to do all together , and i do not want to take longer than four years to finish all that i honestly do not know what i want to do , i want to do something worthwhile , something different , something exciting , something that 's definitely not your average 8 to 5 job , something that truly helps people i only hope that someday i will realize what i want to do although in life , everyone wants something more , no matter what people have , they usually want something more i hope that whatever happens , i am content with what i have man , this shins song , saint simon is so good they are coming to austin soon , i ca not wait to see them bright eyes is also coming soon , in october that is going to be such a good show , it 's been like two years since i have seen them live i think that i can do those three things in four years though , if i take summer school , i think i came in with 36 hours of credit , so i really hope that it 's possible i need to talk to my advisor about that he 's really nice , his name is lovelys he 's also my fig mentor , i am in the business of non profits fig i have always been really interested in non profit businesses and how they run maybe i will work for a non profit business we are supposed to get guest speakers , and we are doing a community service project , so that will be cool well , my time 's almost up , so i will end here ciao
2004_69.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i'm thinking i do not know what to write this popsicle tastes good , i'm really bored , my roommate is gone i'm sitting here in a stupor , not really thinking about anything i'm thinking i miss my girlfriend and i should probably call her when i am done with this the popsicle tastes good i hear the bass from the stereo of person in the room next to me and i think it 's kind of annoying tonight is going to be fun , i am looking forward to that , this popsicle is really good i think i need to clean my room , it 's really messy i need to throw out the food wrappers , put my clothes away , that persons stereo is really annoying , i hear loud voices in the hall , i wonder who they are , it sounds like a cute girl , i need to put my papers and homework away i am going to get another popsicle it tastes good too i wonder if a m doing this assignment correctly i am looking around my room for things to think about , but nothing really sparks any interest i'm really bored i think i will turn the radio on never mind , i think that that might interfere with my stream of consciousness i hear one of my friends voices outside talking about the start of intramural football with somebody i ca not wait for that to start , but i am upset that i have to play coed instead of men 's this other popsicle is really good too i feel papers in my pocket and i take them out , its my bank statements that makes me upset because i see all the things i wasted my money on i throw them on the floor i'm thinking that my time is a little over halfway done , and that makes me feel good because i am looking forward to stop typing this when i am done i think i will take a shower , and then maybe , i'm thinking about something interesting i can do after that , i'm playing racquetball at 5 so something in between that i do not know , maybe i can figure something out when my roommate comes back i'm hungry now i'm eating chips i'm laughing because i'm thinking if you actually read this one you will think i have an obsession with food , which i kind of do but that 's just because i am hungry all the time i really like the chips i'm kind of sleepy too , maybe i will take a nap i was thinking about typing and how i am good at it and that made me think about my grandpa for some reason because he looks really silly when he types and that made me miss him because i have not seen him in over a year maybe i will call him this weekend i love chips and salsa , it 's damn good my roommate is going to be pissed because i am eating them all without him it does not matter though because i am really hungry 2 minutes left i ca not wait till this is over , its been interesting but i want to do other stuff i'm excited though because this counts as a grade and this will be a good start for psychology class i really like these chips well times up and now i'm really happy because i'm done

2004_74.txt 0 0 0 1 1 i'm finally getting around to typing this stream of consciousness thing i do not know why i was procrastinating before , maybe hesitant because i'm subconsciously afraid of what i would write but my dorm does not start its , um , food service thing for 20 minutes and i'm getting tired of uploading all my course assignments from syllabi up to mozilla calendar i'm already typing more coherently than i thought i was going to ( caffeine , maybe does not it clear and speed up your thought process ) 1 56 already if i get to the cafeteria too early i will have to have cereal or something just kicking around until they start preparing real food that happened earlier today , for the first time in fact , because i ignored the castilian food service schedule i guess i'm bound to forget some stuff over the long weekend , first time going back home from austin roommate 's explaining the facebook to suitemate right now his music used to be catchy , but he needs to get more variety i have heard beenie man and uhhhhh young buck maybe two dozen times a day , it 's dumbening me i was expecting my writing to be more ulysses like that 's a great book i even brought it to my dorm but have not had time to read any of it all ( not that i did at home , either ) there 's a guy in my intro linguistics class that looks a lot like james joyce , down to the facial hair and everything god he 's annoying , sucking up to herr doktor and asking questions that a nerf basketball just hit me damn questions to which the answers are overly obvious not that i have anything against him for looking like james joyce i picked my glasses because they looked joycean ( my dad has the same glasses as noam chomsky ) the tiny old vietnamese woman ( 7 23 ) at my optometrists ( all the employees have been vietnamese ong , doan , tran , quach , nguyen , c ) said something bizarre about them making me 'look powerful' it sounded cool at the time , but in retrospect it was really creepy ( 8 39 ) suitemate probably thinks i'm vaguely antisocial because i'm typing furiously instead of playing nerf basketball with him and my roommate the ball just went under my bed there , he got it missed it from as far back as my bed , dropped it again , shot again i was tempted to bring ummmmm not ulysses finnegan 's wake ( no apostrophe , i remembered ) up to my room , as my roommate seems not to care that i already have too lofty of literature here ( i was afraid of seeming to effete if i was stuck with some anti intellectual jock from college station , but it 's fine ) but i already have enough unread books on my shelf not that i do not intend to read it all sometime last time i checked i was on page 168 which i think is quite far for something with almost no coherence at all somewhere i read that joyce revised the text continuously , making it more and more obscure and pun filled and incoherent with each revision which would make strauss happy it 's funny what you learn from harpers magazine apparently the record at shots at the nerf basketball hoop from printer desk range is 4 or maybe 8 maybe adam made 8 and david 4 i was not really paying attention , but ooh , my sister just signed onto aim we need to try that mediterranean restaurant on 24th sometime i occasionally laugh or say something noncommittal or vaguely supportive to show that i'm paying attention to their little basketball game david made 3 now adam 's trying from distance , missed standing right next to me , apparently i'm 3 point range when i grow up i bet i will have to patronize my kids similarly 16 14 i can eat before too terribly long , then i will have to read for history and such and add this class to mozilla calendar david just backed into me ewww this 50 cent song is so violent at first i thought it was catchy , but really it 's just creepy 17 41 he 's putting the onion volume 14 back on my shelf , upside down they are leaving for dinner , asked me if i wanted to come , explained psych writing assignment he does not think he like 's quesadillas they are ok , but i prefer them without too much stuff in them which they always have , except that it 's the do it yourself line which should remedy that so i will be down in a few seconds unless the elevators take too long which they do what else aim got my course packets today it was easier to find but abel 's i had to search for done !
2004_75.txt 0 0 1 1 0 well actually , i don not know what should i write down here i think that this can be a very easy assignment , or this can be a very hard assignment how stupid ! honestly , today , i asked about it to a ta because i could not totally understand what should i do i knew that there is no topic , but no topic can mean the huge categories anyway , this assignment made me confused but , interestingly , a american student asked about what she should do for the assignment in the today 's class at that time , i thought two one is that there is also a person who do not understand the purpose of this assignment like me and the other is that oh , my god ! do not ask me do not ask me because i am an international student who came here in america a month ago so i am not good at listening to what people say yet , especially in the casual conversation you know , young american university students talk so fast hum it is a big problem so , i made her ask the same question three times , and finally , i could tell her what she should do for this assignment how stupid ! ! now i am in a big dilemma i have a difficulty keeping up with classes now , but i feel happy and can relax when i meet friends and drink with them but , i have to study so , i thought that now , i have to meet lots of friends to learn english instead of only studying in the library to keep up with classes i thinks it is a great excuse to play but , what is the priority for me meeting friends to learn english and american culture or studying hard to keep up with all classes with no meeting others so difficult ! ! however , i suddenly wonder can i deal with both of them perfectly so confused wow , time is almost over but , i do not much 36 37 38 44 ok ! i have to finish this ! !
2004_76.txt 1 1 0 0 1 i finally got to see matrix revolutions i do not know what everyone was talking about , saying it was awful it 's funny , everyone i have talked to that loved the 2nd one hated the 3rd one and everyone that hated the 2nd one loved the 3rd one i'm in the latter category i have been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now i think it might have to do with our expectations i loved the first one i was waiting for the second one to come out ever since i heard they were making a trilogy i had good expectations for reloaded , and i went to the theatre to see it on opening night and i was disappointed the interesting thing is that about a month earlier , x men 2 came out i liked the first one a lot , but i was not waiting with bated breath for the 2nd one to come out ( like how it was with reloaded ) my expectations were , shall we say , nonexistent i had not given it a lot of thought about what to expect when i went to that movie theatre to see it , it blew me away after about an hour and a half had gone by , i checked my friend 's watch because i was worried the movie would end soon enough matrix talk i just got back from vegas , and i got to see david copperfield hmmm it might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher 's standpoint , being an illusionist and all i saw through one of his tricks , though it might have been due to the fact that i'm very proficient in visual media i think it might be because i have seen all of those goddamned behind the scenes documentary stuff for the extended versions of fellowship of the ring and the two towers in a way it 's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface i had a point to this copperfield yeah , it was fun i found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological illusions what i mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show again , it might have been better if i had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks the older audience members must have been stumped kenji 's very cute he 's finally decided to settle down for the , oh , i do not know next hour at the most whenever i'm on the computer , he tends to sleep on my cd book so that he can still be close to me , but he 's chosen a different spot instead of being directly to the right of me , he 's directly to the left of me big difference ! before i would moved the computer onto where it is now , i had it closer to the bed on ryan 's desk ken would spend most of his time while i was on the computer on the corner of my bed er , sorry amanda's bed i still ca not get over the time when i talked to her ( a very rare time since the kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and i took her old apartment ) and i was so excited that i would bought this silky linen for , and i quote , my bed you mean my bed , she said i bought it you are only keeping the things in that apartment while i'm gone working on the campaign bullshit when we were kids , do you think we would go around saying to are friends , oh , i have to go now i need to go to my mom 's bed or what i should call my mom 's bed , because she bought it even though i sleep in it every night yeesh ! she 's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent i hope she will get over it , because i really resent the fact that she believes i'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers for some reason that really bugs me ken 's awake and about now it 's making it difficult to type now , because he 's trying to claw the keyboard while i'm typing my times up anyway , so tah !
2004_79.txt 0 1 1 0 1 well since i have this assignment in front of me it is obviously the first thing i am thinking about i wonder if the fact that i have been thinking about doing this assignment will affect what i write down it probably will like , i knew this would happen i was thinking as soon as we got the assignment that sex is always on my mind and since this is college , i think it will be ok to mention it my back itches i got a sunburn yesterday at the beach i knew i probably should have put sunscreen on , but i am a procrastinator , so i never got around to it i kept asking my girlfriend if my back was burning yet , and she kept saying no , but i guess she could not really tell how bad it was my roommate just asked me what we had to read for this class i have not really been keeping up with my reading lately i skipped class today also just because i did not feel like waking up on time my girlfriend probably is not as smart as me , but most of the time she seems like she works harder than me when we first started going out she never used to get mad at me for anything now she is always getting mad at me for everything she used to laugh when ever i would get lost driving around because i have a bad sense of directions , but now she just always yells at me and says where the fuck are you going i never get mad at her for things she does to me though i have infinite almost patience with her she lost a piece to a puzzle i have had since i was like 2 and all i did was tell her not to worry about it but when ever i do something small like step on her sandal at the mall she gets really pissed off and says fuck eric , watch where the fuck your going , that fucking the second time you have done that shit i wish she was not always like that but i still love her very much we have been together for nearly a year now so i am pretty sure we can last if we want to i have economics to do
2004_84.txt 1 0 1 1 0 so i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing with this just typing i guess damn aim no one ever wants to instant message me until i start doing something there are so many times when i am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really , and no one wants to talk the minute i start doing something productive , there is like five people trying to talk to me at once all that typing and its only been two minutes i have no idea what to type can your mind really go blank i mean , i want to use the expression right now , my mind is blank , because i'm not really thinking about anything , but obviously i'm thinking about something because i am typing this stuff so my mind really is not blank then so i guess your mind does not really ever go blank my roommate is funny i keep picturing her when i walked in the door from class earlier she was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face how someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me its looked so funny though i should have took a picture i'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening i am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff ah the new real world is on tonight i absolutely love watching that show all the drama its interesting to watch its kind of sad though i think , the way people love to watch reality shows i mean , they are not really a true picture of reality they film for hours and hours and hours , but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode , and they usually only run for a few months , once a week can u imagine how much film ends up on the cutting room floor as they call it all the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it if not made up completely at least embellished and its all because of editing birthday someone on tv just said the word birthday i'm so excited my birthday is a week from tomorrow yeah ! but i also have my dad 's birthday next week and my boyfriend 's too and i have no idea what to get them actually what to get my boyfriend my dad is easy a gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy my boyfriend i do not know he already has plenty of cologne ( did i spell that right ) so i do not want to get him that and i always buy him clothes i want to get him something different this time but i have no idea what and he is going to be 21 lucky everyone is leaving me behind i am the youngest of a lot of my friends so now they can all go out to the bars without me so sad i still have a whole year to go bleh i hate waiting bleh is that a word i type it a lot on aim its my way to say yucky or boring or i do not know i heard it from somewhere though i ca not remember where ha ha my roommate is up i wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face because it fell off when i came in bleh i am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again i think we should have a fall break kind of like spring break i need my rest its only the third week of school and i'm already so exhausted i need a break
2004_85.txt 1 0 0 0 1 so school has been interesting so far i have come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like , and i have surprised myself to find that it would be completely different at the time , i have become increasingly known by a nickname that was not even self imposed , i have created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to people love dat boi tony but hey i guess i'm not too mad about it it 's good in the end , in some ways , and in some ways not like for example , if i want people to know who i am , then they really do know who i am , and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way , but on the other hand , since people think they know who i am they wo not bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who i am really who am i anyway can it be defined by a label or name does it matter if i am anthony derrell williams , tony , or dat boi tony because some people can remember my name at all i guess in some facets it really is irrelevant , but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant lol it 's like significance drives us , like a since of purpose , much like agent smith from the matrix , but that movie was flawed in itself it had no purpose it started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end , but that just did not work however quentin tarentino , did it right when i he made kill bill , it was a simple plot with a unique character development , and that was the important part many people thought that it was the action , but it truly was the characters that made the movie that 's why vol 2 is better than vol 1 , no matter what the next person tells you sure vol 1 was composed of the best action sequences since the old bruce lee days ( who is still better than jackie chan and jet li ) , but the story itself is what should draw you on another note , a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see , and now he 's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care the problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind , but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature he ca not take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself , the thinks he is fine as who he is emo sux though i had no formulated opinion about it until i seen what it is doing to him he needs help for real the funniest part about it , is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting nietzsche god is dead which is a very interesting quote a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason they are a tool , if they inject reason and use logic to prove why god is alive then they are less of one the point is , that the religious texts , such as the koran , the bible , etc were written by man ( inspired by god ) , which means they are subject to flaws inherently and maybe intentionally , if you could tell the people thus said the lord and you did not want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish then that 's what you would tell them after all some people read from texts translated by shakespeare but i digress i as a christian would only have this much to say in return if god is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed and if he truly is god and did exist , death has no binding power defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic what is death , what is death to a man , what is death to a beast , what is death to a god and then i would say yes , god in the form of man ( jesus ) did die , for you and i there 's always a way to explain something in the logical realm , however some people are too closed minded to see even that sometimes , philosophy , even pomo philosophy , can be used to solidify faith because it makes somebody question themselves and why the believe what they believe and if the answers to the self examination are satisfactory that persons faith has become that much stronger well yester i went to a labor day cookout and there were some fine ladies there you never notice how good somebody looks until they try to look good for you that 's the funny part about it all , i do not try that hard enough i just wonder what other people 's perception is of me could i have had a chance with any of those girls , probably , but not likely and this is where my reckoning begins what are these girls looking for attention relationships or just good sex i could provide them with all 3 , but hey there 's only a small amount of me to go around all jokes aside , with the truth being told , i really think attention is the centric thing that girls want how they translate different actions to be attention is a different story , because girls are all so different but all so much the same when the picture is generalized and magnified to show detail and i like to look at detail that 's why i think i might be staying single for a while even as hard as that is in a place like ut austin

2004_93.txt 1 1 0 1 1 my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty sweaty boy i came over to his apt to do this homework and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves i am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal i'm usually a really fast typer , because i have had a computer for a long time my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house he wanted me to do computer science and i did as well , but when i came to ut i found out it is totally wrong for me i just switched to retail merchandising and i'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than cs was i think its funny how older people ( no offense ) are not really connected to the computer the computer , can do so many wonderful things , i ca not even see my life without one do not think i'm a dork just because i said i was in cs , but take for example doing this homework online its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it it was a very easy simple task that 's amazing they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and i believe it there is just so much to do online i feel like i might be typing bad , but i would like you to excuse that i'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing i wonder what you actually look for in these type of things , how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups i mean i would hate to see what you think of me now , but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true so i totally love paris hilton , she is such a riot i think its funny people do not like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show but i wont get into that , however she came out with a new book i want to read it , i think it will be amusing on a side note , i'm not really sure why i'm eating cheetos , i do not really like them , just every now and then i crave them i absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling i just dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in your teeth i really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself i never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long maybe because i'm starving and i just want to go eat and go to tops , it feels like that i hate that how are you suppose to do something that feels like eternity i feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go i was going to do it earlier but i was having a hard time getting the pre screening thing to work then once i did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with , because its so freaking slow i still have to go back and finish that and i dread it however , i think my boyfriend is entertained now because i can here he is playing playstation two in the next room gosh i'm so hungry and this is taking way to long i have now moved on to goldfish to eat speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating wow i feel bad that so many people have eating disorders , i know quite a few so many things for girls to be stressed about i hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all they think its all just food related i hate how little kids are so fat today i wish people would help teach kids how to eat they let them eat anything they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise or they do not set the example themselves my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done all their homework and their daily chore then they also get a snack sized candy ( the little bitty bite size ) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day crazy crazy i wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation i'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed i ca not imagine it not being computer timed i ca not imagine being the person who reads all this crap it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail but that could happen anywhere i guess i'm so hungry its not funny i'm glad i do not have to pee or anything that would just suck i feel like my mind is going blank because i'm so bored i wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this it would be easy gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top does not have any numbers like its keeping time per say i'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing does not stop itself because i know i will be over the time if i wait till 4 so you ca not cut my grade cause your thing did not work oh crap this clock is fast so i will quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even i feel like i started this at 3 30 hmmmmmm i ca not really remember damn it this sucks ass i do not see how this is helping you just making me get annoyed because i do not know when i started so i dont know when i can end and just go on with my life i wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder i feel like this is pointless and i'm past my typing time i have no concept of time , but i do not know if anyone really does just depends on what they are doing or what 's going on around them and etc time is a funny thing more goldfish to cure my growling stomach boredom ouch i just kicked the computer or something underneath me and it hurt to bad i'm not on my computer cause then i could be laying in bed doing this wireless and laptops genius the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t minus 3 minutes and counting 3 55 will be the new time for completion 3 more minutes and i'm stumped i do not know what to type talk about ooooooo 2 minutes and counting ok randomness i am not sure what i'm going to do tonight , i might go to a party or something , however i'm not going to dress up really cause i'm just feeling a chill vibe 0ne minute and probably have a few drinks , or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend sweet guy not sure we are completely on the same page , but we have years for that to develop times up
2004_94.txt 0 0 1 1 1 so this is the third time that i have tried to do this for some reason my computer is having some problems this morning explorer crashed and so i had to reboot my machine which can take a while it 's amazing how slow pc 's get after you install anti virus software in the process of it rebooting i went and made a cup of coffee bavarian hazlenut form heb , delicious so i was thinking about this assignment and how it was similar to an assignment i took in a humanities class a while back they asked us to spend 20 minutes alone somewhere , anywhere just thinking about anything and making notes i spent it in the campus parking lot , a wide open space , fairly peaceful , trees swaying in the summer breeze and began making notes , not really sure of the purpose after the 20 minutes was up i realized that i was much more in tune with all of my senses than at the start normally i would walk around just using the sense that were needed , sight , hearing and focused on coordination , driving , etc during the 20 minute period in the parking lot i became aware much more of my sense of touch , the feel of the paper i was writing on , the smell of my surroundings , the movement of the trees as they swayed in the breeze , i have mentioned that twice now , what does that mean i just finished my first cup of coffee my apologies about my spelling i have a tendency to just type first and ask questions about my spelling later i do not know how this app handles me jumping back to correct spelling i hope i'm not confusing it probably not a thought of sunny beaches just jumped into my head for no reason south padre on a breezy summer evening again this breeze thing , what 's with that in fact i'm thinking about the breeze that may be outside right now i just went out to feed the cats and it was cool and a little breeze was in the air perhaps i need to go outside when i'm done here and soak it up it 's like a vitamin that the body is lacking , eventually you crave something that subconsciously you know gives you that vitamin for some reason , perhaps i did not get out enough at the weekend , i need to feel the breeze central market , i have a coupon to central market sitting in front of me i like that place and apparently if i go there this week and spend 30 or more then i can get 10 off rib eye steaks the fan spins slowly overhead , a gentle clicking , a low hum , the sound of my typing and then , silence why are keyboards so awkward is not there a better way to do this surely a psychologist somewhere has studied this and come up with something , more ergonomic i'm thinking about my brother i just spent 2 5 months in the u k during the summer working for him , selling they are a web services company he is the owner and a good guy he is the glue that keeps many things together he has 3 kids who are all precious one has a spine problem and ca not walk that unfortunately is the extent of my knowledge english people are strange in that they make it hard to communicate simple things to each other they do things that they think are right but in fact are completely wrong i got attacked while i was in the u k in the street at 8 30 in the morning on friday the 13th i was on my way to work and got attacked the police there are awful they just do not care they are nowhere to be found in the most obvious situations where you would think they would be they hide and when you least need them they are there to hassle you i have not been hassled but they are that kind of personality just my impression power hungry wimps no idea for the big picture , just cya and demonstrate what little power you have why ca not they quantities the biggest problems and formulate a response and go about resolving it did you know that england has now clearly taken over the spot of the capitol for drunks in europe the british government will be introducing laws next year to combat the problem why do they not have a public intoxication law now you can be drunk in the street hassling old ladies and get away with it while the police stand by and chat to one another ! ! ! ! well my time is almost up in fact a notice just came up time to go hope this has not been boring have a great day go usa ! ! !
2004_97.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i do not know why , but for some reason i am extremely nervous about this writing assignment it most likely wo not even be read ! random , but i started thinking about what an awful driver i am in austin all of the one way streets and stop signs that people do not stop at are very overwhelming i have already ran two red lights whoops since this writing assignment is online , i ca not help but read the instant messages that pop up while i'm typing i love talking to people online , i think i'm addicted it really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family now that we are all living in different cities especially since two of my best friends are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school , i can talk to them all at the same time it is very convenient since coming to college i have become obsessed with downloading music from itunes tomorrow night the sig eps are having an 80 's theme party , so last night i spent about an hour downloading hit songs from the 80 's my friends and i are going to have a pre dance party in my dorm room it will be awesome today my friend melanie and i went shopping at thrift stores to find 80 's garb i found the best 80 's pumps for only six dollars can you say jackpot i think my favorite 80 's song right now has to be jessie 's girl by rick springstein i wish i was jessie 's girl , because then i would date his best friend speaking of dating , i think dating in college is going to be rather difficult considering there are approximately 50 gorgeous girls on campus to every one attractive guy not that looks are everything , but that is what generally draws two people together to start talking actually i think that is usually the case , but i am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the attractive hard asses racquetball is my new favorite sport i have played five times since i have been here it 's really the best work out it 's so much better than running for 20 minutes just play racquetball for 45 minutes and you ca not breath it 's such a great feeling i have had a few complaints though , because i tend to accidentally hit the person i am playing with a little too often than necessary i have hit my sister like twice and i could not even guess how many times i have hit christy whoops ! i love going to concerts they are probably on my top 5 favorite things to do list , along with snowboarding , eating , sleeping , and dancing i wish we had some snow nearby , but i would hate to live in the cold so i guess i do not really want snow close by i almost went to school in boulder , colorado but i realized i would have to wear about 5 layers of clothing just to walk to class and i decided it just was not worth it i am a texan , if i did not break a sweat between classes i do not know what i would do with myself i ca not wait to take trips over the holidays with my new college friends i have been looking forward to that for a
2004_99.txt 0 1 0 1 0 i am currently thinking about how ready i am to go home this weekend i did not go home for labor day weekend because my girlfriend came here to visit me i ca not wait to see her and see if she is feeling better she has been sick for the last four days i also ca not wait to drive my new car i just got it this summer but i have not been able to drive it because i do not want to bring it to austin i wonder what we are going to do in psychology today i wonder if he is going to do another demonstration like he did last class i just drew a blank and ca not think of what to say next i really want to go watch a movie this weekend because i have not went to the movies in a really long time i wonder what i will buy kim for her birthday in december probably some flowers and some chocolate and maybe buy her a gift certificate to get a massage i wonder what she will buy me for christmas she said it was something i have been wanting but i did not know i have been wanting anything i hope the camera i bought on saturday is going to be here this week i bought the new sony dsc t1 which is the credit card size digital camera sony makes i ca not wait to get it i have been wanting the camera now for six months i miss my 1967 camaro i restored it this year and during the summer i went to florida and traded it in for a 2002 ss camaro wow what a change that car hauls butt and is nice because it has air conditioning which the 67 did not i still have my 68 camaro and i will probably be wanting to restore that one pretty soon my dream is to be a orthodontist and i ca not stop thinking about if and when i will realize if this dream could be a reality i know i have to wait 3 more years to apply to dental school but i ca not tell if i will have high enough grades to get accepted i really hope my chemistry class is not as hard as i am making it out to be i took chemistry ap last year in high school so i would be prepared but i feel a little discouraged i wonder what experiments i will sign up for in psychology i have been looking but i have not found one with my interest i wonder if my dad is really going to help me get a racecar because i have always wanted to race and two weeks ago we went to the track to see if we were interested and my dad said we probably will race next year my father raced when he was my age and i have always wanted to follow in his footsteps he was very good and i have seen proof from the programs that he was in i am starting to smell the food i just recently cooked it smells like pizza maybe because that 's what i fixed duh my eyes are starting to hurt from looking at the screen without looking away i am getting really annoyed by the people living on the top floor they keep making noise it sounds like an elephant is walking on top of me it is disrupting my train of thought i am really hoping that tonight i can take a break and not have to do any homework
2004_101.txt 1 0 1 1 1 wow i just turned on my music a little too loud that really scared me for a second let 's get this straightened out a bit i'm so glad i'm listening to this cd it reminds me of chris , who i miss terribly at the moment i wonder why he did not call me back last night well i guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do , his chemistry homework and stuff like that i think it 's really funny that his roommate 's name is hank and he 's chinese , that 's just funny my feet are really cold even though i have on socks and my slippers i guess it 's just that i always get really cold in hardin house i do not know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here everything 's going to be alright , rockabye i like this song a lot all her friends tell her she 's so pretty , she would be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while so fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and i think that 's going to be a lot of fun , except i do not know , the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out i get really claustrophobic , especially when i feel like i ca not breathe , kind of like when i go to sleep and i like to pull the covers up over me but i always have to make sure there 's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out anyways , i think it will be fun but i'm not sure if i'm going to get in the whole way i have been in a whiteout once , that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary , i kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face , and hopefully not as cold though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe , like you feel like you ca not get any fresh air like a breeze or anything but i still really want to go in just for a minute to say i have done it but leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam , and i do not know i'm worried because mark is a fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there i wonder why he 's been telling his friends about me i really do not like that because i really do not like him and i know he likes me but he 's kind of crazy and obsessive almost , though he 's really nice , it just seems like he tries way too hard like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that hmmmmmm interesting like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he 's like analyzing everything i say , like i sound stupid but he 's just not saying anything kind thing i do not know i just really do not like that at all and i think he 's a little gay well maybe not gay , but definitely metro i think it 's really funny that i have spelled definitely my whole life , and it 's always been wrong but i just ca not retrain myself to get it right kind of like weird or weird i still get them mixed up because i know i used to always write it one way and it was wrong , but now i do not know which way is right because i can never remember if i ever actually fixed it or not i think it 's weird weird whatever weird that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we are going to go with that i do not know what i think about will he 's also a fiji , so if i go to foam i get to see him but i also have to deal with mark , so that 's kind of like a double edged sword damned if you do damned if you do not situation i got sick of the hyphens anyways , i think he 's a really sweet guy and all , but he 's just so quiet ! but at the same time it 's like i'm drawn to him almost because he 's a dry pledge and he 's cute but not all at the same time , i'm sick of this song and i'm changing it this one is happier but back to will i just do not know what i think of him or that whatever i am leaving cause i love you , i am leaving cause i do not and i'm hoping you will follow and i'm praying that you wo not let me go i want to know who sings this song , chris never told me i still ca not believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday , i really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age i miss bo i could never tell if he really liked me or not , kind of like travis , because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time , like hey bo how you doing i'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing i do not know scratch my neck anyways i never really knew about that but i have always liked him , 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party , i ca not believe he did not remember that at all and i thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself i love that story , it 's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and chris both wanted to ask me , and then after that when bo liked me and i liked chris and they were fighting over me i wonder if it was right that i brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun i ca not believe i actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and i'm glad chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though i know bo really wanted him to , i'm glad bo did not force the issue too much though because i would have felt bad but i did not want him to do that around me i hate smoking so much i hope andrew quits it will kill him i think it 's so funny that leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the fiji island party , i'm glad i was not there because i think i would have been really embarrassed i guess that 's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places it 's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it 's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they are doing but i like not drinking , and i like feeling like i do not have to and people accept that it 's really kind of nice wow i only have like 3 and a half minutes left that 's pretty cool but i sure am getting there two dimes in the telephone alright , no it 's not easy tonight good song i really do love this cd i wonder if michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd , i really would love that or maybe if chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it i loved that he first played that for me outside of casey 's house what were we doing over there were we going to a concert or something maybe i do not remember ha ha hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey 's brothers they are so hot but kevin 's married now i do not like how i just sounded like a bimbo there i really am smart i promise i feel really stupid in my world lit class though because i have never taken latin and i have not studied greek , and i do not know i just feel like i'm behind the ball here on dante 's inferno i like the book a lot but i'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far so do not make the wrong impression i do not want raffa to think i'm like stupid it 's like in hagood 's class though i guess i just have to learn when to speak up , it 's like i'm wow that just interrupted me and i had no idea where i was going i guess i just get writing and i have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode i guess that 's what i have to do when i start writing a paper because instinctively i start editing myself before i even begin and then i just end up never really getting anywhere well i'm done here goodbye
2004_102.txt 1 0 0 1 1 damn , i'm really hungry my girlfriend was really hungry too , so she came over to make some spaghetti i guess it 's already almost 6pm , so dinner would not be a bad thing in fact , it would be a good thing it 's pretty hot outside today i have a horrible crick in my neck almost like i have been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled when i look to the left , it all seems to go away perhaps i should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms i should start studying more often i passed my computer proficiency test today not like i was terribly worried about it though i had my first quiz at ut today as well i ended up reading for my financial accounting class for an hour and a half at the aim reading room at the school of business i did a few homework problems at the end , but did not finish them if i would have been reading for my mis class , i probably would have been prepared for the quiz it 's pretty straightforward stuff though especially with me being a certified microsoft and citrix network administrator my roommate chad has been really sketchy lately i think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships damn , those italian herbs smell really good it 's making my mouth start to water really bad i took a painting class last semester and did a few works one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention i also have a double dave 's cup on my desk which is one of my favorite places to eat i think i'm going to turn some music on now empty thoughts i'm now listening to the sound of 311 ( their self titled album to be more specific ) i wonder if you all will actually read these my thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since i have started listening to the music oop now it 's picking up again i have a stack of cd 's on top of my monitor do you do you have a stack of anything i once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch the code to their ranch was 1991 , because that 's the year they purchased it the funny thing is , he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him , his mom , his dad , and his two dogs into being his screen name this sucks that the time is going by so slowly at first it seemed to pass by really quickly with the lines of text slowly appearing , but the time going by in increments of 30 seconds the spaghetti is ready damnit , i'm hungry but i have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one i wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color maybe because it looks similar to gold and gold is a precious commodity my stomach feels like it 's burning right now those aromas are filling my nose wooooo hooooo ! my girlfriend , laura , just brought me a plate full of spaghetti and meatballs to have a bite as much as i really want to sit here and keep typing , i think i'm going to grab a drink to pair with my spaghetti dr pepper is pretty awesome i can type and watch tv at the same time i never thought being able to type without looking would be that good of a thing now i get to use it while trying to complete my psychology assignment yeeeaaaah ! the assignment is over
2004_103.txt 1 0 0 1 1 this writing assignment is very interesting it is strange how it is somewhat difficult to simply write whatever i am thinking sometimes it is hard to tell i really need to catch up on some of my homework i also need to find a job high school was so much different than college is that is not necessarily a bad thing just different i like living in austin there is much more to do than there is in a town of under 300 people i am hungry where should i eat lunch today my parents are coming down this weekend i think i will leave to many people in a little apartment i do not really think i could handle it i got a cat well a kitten actually to keep my company it whines a lot and likes to crawl up my leg i have not really talked to that many people from back home since i have been here but that does not really bother me i need new people meeting people here is harder than i thought it would be i figured since this is a huge campus that it would be easy and just kind of happen but it turns out i think i might actually have to make an effort to meet new people i really need to find a job hopefully on campus that would be great i am looking forward to psychology class today it is interesting i want to learn how people think because i wish i knew a lot of the time but i do not really think that is something you can learn because everyone 's mind works differently , so how can you learn how people think if it not the same with any one person how can you know the emotions and thoughts of the people around you i have a hard time knowing the thoughts and emotions of my closest friends and even myself at times the mind is so complex i have thought about majoring in psychology i just wish i had some clue as to what i want to do with my life it 's like i am here , in college , finally , and i have no idea what to do with it i guess i will figure it out i just get tired of waiting for that sudden thought to just pop into my head and me know that is what i want to do for the rest of my life that 's a long time i want to do something i enjoy somewhere where i will be happy but i guess that is what everybody wants but why do some people find that , and not others what makes the lucky ones different i guess if everyone did what the wanted then there would be nobody to do the dirty work but it just seems unfair that some have it so could and some can never find that place where they feel content does that place really exist i think so i do not think i have quite found it though i think i will though maybe i will be one of those lucky ones i miss jason is this going to work do i want it to i do but there are so many things to experience here will it change me he thinks so but i do not know maybe it will maybe it should but where does that leave us is there an us i have no idea how to handle that situation my parents are going crazy they miss me so much i miss them , but am relieved to not be in there household anymore i needed some freedom i need to learn to live on my own i really do not want a job though it will be hard to balance work and school and homework but i need to money i guess i have to eat and pay rent i am really getting hungry i am not really that tired considering i got up at 7 this morning surprising i have not even taken a nap i do not think i will i rode the shuttle from my apartment this morning i usually drive but i ca not afford to pay 7 everyday it was not that bad but i did not really know where it was going to take me but i made it to class on time and did not have to walk that far i just hope i am able to catch it this afternoon i think i know where it will pick me up but i do not know what time it runs really and how late it runs but i should be done here around 5 cause i have a class from 3 30 till 5 i really need to go to the gym i think i am going to talk some dance classes that sounds like fun and i bet it will help me meet more people i need to talk to jason let him know i care and that i think about him a lot i know he worries i worry to i need to quit stressing about everything so much i worry myself to much i guess that is human nature though who knows what human nature really is maybe that is just an excuse for the way we act i know i use it as an excuse at times that 's kind of sad but i guess everyone probably does wow my times almost up that did not seem like 20 minutes when you just start letting your thoughts go i guess time goes by pretty quickly i think i might take a nap but i have more homework that needs to be done dang there is so much reading i get tired
2004_104.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i am watching an episode of mad tv and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest alterboy thing , singing nelly 's hot in herre the whole thing makes me sick when i think about it my desktop died on me while i was up at ut and i am shopping for a new computer the soonest i could get one would probably be christmas , because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and i would never see it but it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did at least i still have my laptop , even thought it is a brick , weighing over 10 pounds , but i chose it and paid for it all in all , life on the computer side just sucks i wrote this during labor day long weekend , so i just sitting here at home in houston until tomorrow when i go back to austin for a long haul , as i call it where i do not go back home until another holiday long weekend but i do not mind , i really enjoy living in austin , although the dorm i live in sucks due to construction noises i have late classes on tth and i do not get up until like 11 , but i still am awakened by construction at 10 or so even though i did not know my roommate until i move in with him , i do not regret going potluck he is pretty cool , and he respects my wishes and i do the same for him he has early classes on the same days that i do , so he does not bother me when he gets up in the morning , and i do not bother him when i wake up , because he has the same classes at the same times as i do so that is cool it 's an oddity that i am writing this , for i do not really know how to write papers so i decided to write this like i would for my blog on livejournal , like i am writing to my best friends when i get back to austin , i need to get my calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to , just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again sadly ii feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at ut , into my freshman year but the work is not the problem , the problem is the walking , but i will have to just get used to that aspect of ut

2004_108.txt 0 0 0 0 1 hello , my name is jason i felt like i needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment , and i am not familiar with that person anyhow , lets talk about some stuff hmm , where should i begin i was born in alice if your thinking this is like a biography , then i think that you will be wrong however , back to what i was saying i do not really like traveling to alice , tx i find it kind of boring because i do not have anyone over there that is my age all of my relatives are much older than i these people do not tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create lets talk about my uncle for instance i will not mention his name , however , he was i mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail why would i be interested in going and visiting him unless i wanted some crack or something he is a liar anyways , and i do not like affiliating myself with those kinds of people speaking of the kind of people i affiliate ( if that 's even how u spell the word ) myself with , i think that i accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester had to look over my shoulder to make sure he 's not behind me or something however , he makes a lot of homosexual remarks , and although he says he is just playing , i think he does it all too frequently to be playing around anyways , i'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday lets talk about my big brother now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out this is the reason that i look up to him he knows how to manage his time , talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time , go out on the weekends , and still get all a 's ! i have to admit that i am somewhat jealous however , he does help me out and gives really great advice when he tutors me , i feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how i retain material he is two years older than me , but i am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight lets talk about my boxing , because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that i feel is so precious to a person i hated not being respected it made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and i could not do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me however , i put an end to all that crap when i joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school i learned how to fight the hard way though my coach sucked and did not teach me a thing , so i just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade i adopted a slugger 's style of fighting the reason is because my foot movement was never all that great my strength began to get developed when i began lifting weights in my freshman year , and it suited my fighting style great that year , a couple of kids decided to mess with me , so i took them to the mat room ( part of the gym in my high school ) , and floored them one by one man it was great , the respect that those fights generated was awesome from then on out , word of mouth about those fights got me my respect i did not even have to fight anymore ! but i kept on because i got too competitive and i kind of liked it currently , i'm undefeated in my hometown however , i was just an average fighter when it came to the golden gloves i stopped when i started college that 's enough of that my father is the next person i want to discuss he has worked his way from rock bottom , and i admire that he slept in a car for 6 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away ( for a railroad company called southern pacific ) he helps us out so much and he 's funding my tuition for college all by himself ( cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago ) i still love her and all , i just do not agree with anything she does she seems to have tunnel vision , u know what i mean let me explain because my time here is almost up she is one of those people who will see something she wants , and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing , no matter who she hurts today she seems more like a stranger , cause i do not see her all that much she did not invite me to her wedding my time is up talk to u later bye
2004_109.txt 0 0 0 0 1 i just failed my chemistry quiz i feel depressed i could have gotten the correct answer it was just that i was answering the question incorrectly at first i thought it was the ta 's fault , maybe she done the test wrong but as i was turning in the quiz i finally realized that i had been solving for the wrong question hey there 's a squirrel with a piece of pizza that is bigger than him ! ! ha ha , cute anyways , i was turning in the quiz when i realized this oh well it was too late anyways i wonder if that 's how it feels when you die and go to heaven and actually realize you were praying for the wrong person or to no one at all just a waste of time there 's a lot of people around here , thank you the group of people that came up with wireless internet there 's really nothing much going around in my mind right now , except for the whole feeling guilty depressed for failing that chem quiz i went to the hpo to pick up the application for the jamp program they want at least a 3 25 gpa and 3 0 gpa in the science areas in order to be admitted into it i already failed my chem quiz , what to do i have a test next week in chemistry , hopefully i will learn from my previous mistakes in my quiz and i will get an a hhahaha , squirrels they are so funny and cute , they are everywhere around this campus , that 's what i love about it here , the whole not so dirty as houston thing going on its so clean , well around here it is still have not seen the rest of austin i bet squirrels back at home would not even come up this close as the ones in here do , what is love i have been thinking about that , i want to believe my practical side and think that it is nothing but a bunch of hormones hitting your pleasure area in the brain or that love is just conformity , you find someone stay with them because you never want to be alone again or is love really something else , do we stay alive for it is it really forever even after you die maybe that 's just something we want to believe in because we are also afraid of being alone even after we die do we really need love to be happy i mean love as in an only one your significant other , do we really need that kind of love to be happy in life , or is it really just another experience we go through what is love to women are they just trying to find another paternal figure in their life in order to replace the one they had when they were young i mean think about it , if a girl had a bad experience with her dad , she would view all men the same so lets say she lost her respect for him , we will she then lose respect for all men will she be able to be in a healthy relationship all these questions , and i ca not type fast i'm a slow typer but yeah , why are we here anyways is life nothing but insignificant events that happen in no random order and were really just nothing at all i mean i'm sure if all of humanity died , the earth would still spin , maybe the earth will be better with out all of us sometimes we think we are the center of the universe but really we are nothing at all , just a speck in the abyss of the dark universe ew , there was some stuff on my hands where did it come from maybe a bird pooped on me , you ca not trust those birds i rubbed it all over my forehead , maybe i should check what it is , wait i have to finish this thing i'm thinking about majoring in some other field now , like psychology , but i love my current hahahaha there is a squirrel in the trash can ! ! how cute so psychology sounds interesting buy i also looooooooove biology maybe there 's a biopsychology major out there , i mean biology and psychology do go in hand right
2004_110.txt 1 1 1 1 0 right now i'm feeling overwhelmed at all the work that has been given to me there is so much reading that i have to get done and so little time with all the classes i am taking right now i am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done right now i am hearing dead silence as my roommates and i are all studying in the same room i am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me right now i am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but i'm trying my best to stay awake as i type , i'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if i'm ever going to get that done tonight at this instant i'm noticing how there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much i miss them i'm wondering about how tomorrow 's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day i am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how i am going to pass them i'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time , a way to prevent me from procrastinate , and a way to stay in control with my study habits right now i also feel sad because i really miss my family it 's so hard for me to be away from them because i'm so close to them i especially miss my little bother and little sister they always make me laugh today my day was tough i hardly understood what was going on in there so i had to stay after class and ask questions as for my critical thinking seminar , i had a hard time participating mainly because of what the topic was about right now i'm hearing no noise at all and it 's just making me tired i feel very cold right now because the fan is right in front of me and it 's making my eyes dry
2004_113.txt 0 0 1 0 1 ok , so i guess i just type here for twenty minutes hrm interesting you know i think this will get very boring really fast ( and my roommate asks so you just write anything crazy dude ) wow i thought at least something would come but er never mind i do not know really what to write about great and only a minute and a half into it er hrm , maybe write about this computer , or the fact that i do not have one yet that sucks in college and i have to either go to a lab or use someone else 's computer while constantly i see others around on their own machines i have a phone call ! yay my 'mentor' telling me about an event in front of ecj weird trying to type and talk at the same time about two completely off different things eh phone 's off coming on five minutes now almost so i was early you know this ca not all be that interesting typing for a solid twenty minutes most of these papers must be extremely boring unless someone goes off and just starts telling a story or something hrm , sounds like maybe something to do well , it all began a long time ago well , long in the sense that they were young when it began that time period to others may just be what they consider a few years or so ( did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window very annoying i must say ) ( i need a name er , samsung monitor , ok the character 's name is sam ) sam had been a small child when his father disappeared , therefore he had little memory of him all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person , constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting , except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do they also told him of when his father was younger he would disappear for days on end , supposedly off camping or exploring by himself , and would return different how different , they could not quite say , but something changed in him , not always for the better often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks , but after time , he would return to his energetic self ( i notice i seem to misspell quite a bit and even though i try to catch and fix the word as i type it , some words do get through without my notice and i would rather not go back and change them also i tend not to capitalize much when typing this is probably due to the fact that i have grown to accustomed to writing in word and it will capitalize certain things automatically that and i am usually too lazy to remember to do so ) after sam 's father disappeared the last time , his mother fell into a strange illness there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness it was as if something from another world something definitely there but not
2004_114.txt 1 1 0 0 1 well i guess i am just supposed to start writing well i will start by telling this computer about my day today i went to class , well first i was supposed to wake up at 5 45 am but instead i pushed my snooze button one too many times and ended up sleeping until 6 45 , my bus leaves at 7 00 so i missed my bus , the third time this school year , i just ca not seem to get it together but anyways i arrived to my class 25 minutes late , and since it was my third time late to this class it was slightly embarrassing , especially since the only two doors into the classroom are right where the teacher is teaching so i slowly made my entrance and went and sat in the back of the class , and for once i did not fall asleep ! amazing ! i then decided to do my chemistry homework that i thought was due today but its really not due till thursday so i wasted my time off doing homework that was not even due , not like i understood much of it anyways well so then i was out of school for the day ! my boyfriend , john , does not get out of class until 1 15 and it was only 12 30 so i decided to go to barnes and nobles and finish reading an interesting book i had started a week ago its called a boy called it its actually a very upsetting book because its about this boy who endured horrible child abuse for the better part of his childhood his mother was basically insane she played horrible games with him , like making him burn his own arm over the stove , making him eat his brother 's dirty diaper , and starving him to death , not to mention beating him to a pulp everyday and his family just stood by and watched him take it what kind of father could watch his son be abused like that and not do anything that just makes me sick well so anyways i almost finished the book when john called and picked me up so we could hang out so we watched hannibal oh what a creepy movie ! the grossest part was when he took the scalp off one cop and scooped out some of his brain while he was still alive and then , fed it to him ! it was pretty disgusting so after that we just kind of hung around his house doing nothing , but i love the fact that i can just do nothing with him and not be bored but oh the drama that our relationship has caused with our friends ! i do not even want to get into it hmmm i'm thinking about going downstairs and getting myself another cookie , i'm addicted ! i'm a chocoholic ! but seriously i need to start working out , or eating less or something because i'm feeling a little on the chunky side maybe tomorrow i will do that yea right , like i have the time i will just starve myself , naw those cookies are just too darn good ! i'm so happy that this medication i'm taking is finally feeling like its working ! i'm so tired of feeling sad and depressed all the time , and a couple nights ago i just took it way too far the thought of cutting myself again just makes me sick now so i'm getting better ! i think its funny that professor pennebaker told us not to make this a cry for help , because a few weeks ago it might have been and i would have been one of the lost causes wow , that cookie really sounds good this music also sounds good , i like music a lot , it just seems like a great way to express yourself ! even though i do not play anything , and i ca not sing worth crap i like to listen to music as a release right now i'm very into alternative rock and new age rock last night i downloaded 6 hours worth of music onto this computer so now i'm set for life ! nirvana is a cool band , too bad kurt cobain killed himself he was a great musician ! he killed himself on my birthday , how weird is that speaking of birthdays i need to get my mom a birthday present ! maybe i will have time on thursday before defensive driving class ! i sure hope so

2004_119.txt 1 0 1 1 1 there is so much going on my room right now , some it probably is not the best time to be writing right now well i guess it will give them more to think about there is this song on rt now i think its called legionaries its cool it makes me think of like knights and stuff , its kinds up beat and fun my roommate is talking to her dad about her palm pilot i love the way he said boulevard its like the greatest british accent i have been to britain well i mean england either way i want to have a friend who is british like a guy friend i guess because i do not think id want to date a british guy , they all have gross teeth , i do not really understand that like do they not go to the dentist or know what a toothbrush is or something oh i do not think i have ever seen a british person with braces either i guess it has to be something to do with the dentist i just changed the song on my cd player , the song was called clementine which reminds me of my favorite movie , well one of my favorite movies , i have like a ton of favorite things , they are never ending i'm always like yeah this is my fav song or this is my fav band , and the person i am talking to will be like wait i thought you said that blah blah was your fav band , and then i'm like well yeah them too well anyway one of my fav movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , its so weird but you know those are fav type of movies , i do not think i have a fav that everyone else like and i do not so it on purpose to be diff or anything oh and by the way i absolutely ca not stand those type of people who feel that they have to be diff so they do stuff so blatantly different just so that they will be the center of attention , drives me nuts , like people who dye their hair like crazy colors or people who wear weird like way out there kind of clothes , and i bet is you were to ask them why their hair looks like that or why they are wearing that they will just tell you i have lost my train of thought , what i was going to say was not really going to make any sense my roommate uses her palm pilot for everything , i do not know if i could deal using one of those for everything , i could not live without my comp , but my cell phone has a lot of the options that palm pilots do like a calendar and alarms a phone book so whatever i think i should get my blood sugar measured , because i think since i have been at college all i do now is eat , and not healthy foods , i have to have something sweet all the time , it is kind of showing on my figure i was just thinking about how i looked in a leotard today in my ballet class , i'm not as comfortable being in one as i used to be oh this girl in ballet class had just done some center combo with me and we were waiting for everyone else to go and she was like are you gong to try out for the dance team and i was like no but i think i want to try out for the steel dance company and she was like oh are not tryouts this weekend and i was like yeah and she was like oh you will do great you are really really good , i was happy to hear her say that , just to have someone compliment me on my dance skills is such a boost of self esteem especially before tryouts this weekend , i got back to my dorm room and i was so happy , that can also be because i talked to david rt after my class , we are really doing well i think after this weekend , things have steadily been getting back on track with us , i really think i am in love with him , i think the whole break up only made us stronger , that happened the first time we sort of broke up , i wish we could just spend all of our time with each other , i really do miss him a lot , and the thing is if we had not broken up this summer i wanted to break up with him before we started college because i wanted to date other people , but the truth is i have only been comparing other guys to him , i guess that 's what happens , i mean i have seen cute guys but i have not really met any yet , so i do not know if that 's a good ting or not , anyway david wanted to make it official that we were back together last weekend but its hard because i ca not really trust him and neither can my parents , so that really sucks because i really do still want to be with him but my mom is like seville your a fool and blah blah and sometimes i feel like i kind of am because i start to doubt myself so much about the decision i'm making about us , its like would i follow my heart or mind it sounds like a stupid line out of a movie but that 's really how i feel , i think things are looking up and i think my hearts motives are starting to blend with my mind 's
2004_122.txt 0 0 0 0 0 i'm thinking i do not know what i'm thinking its like my mind is still working although i do not know what to write i wonder how the keyboard came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are my history class will be more difficult than i anticipated , my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about i wonder if he 's married , i think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife i knew a guy at my high school like that , he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him , i never understood it he was friends with the craziest people terrill had a death wish he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge i wonder why the timer is not working i thought a timer was counting down when pennebaker did this site as an example in class i will just stop the timer when 20 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working i hate computers i hate computing computing is going to be a bad class that i am not looking forward too ut is a beautiful campus i like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking i want to get a bike so i can ride to psychology quickly on mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after i'm worried about kaitlin i think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but i think war might change her in some way she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers i hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things i have ever seen in my life if a sandspider attacked me i would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life rishi is making a weird ass noise like breathing when you are lifting weights or something brian is my best friend and he almost died it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die i am 18 and invincible or so i thought this must change the entire way he views life do not treat it as something to take for granted it is definitely a gift and some people just do not understand that they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse i need to get a rug our room is dirty i'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long i like the way the window faces north i can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning i want to buy a hang glider really really bad what is my fascination with flight , it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot i do not know i hope i did not choose the wrong career path with the one i have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless i become moderately rich i hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel , even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever i wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport that might be a fun job maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world austin is a cool city i think if my job permits me , i would like to stay here for a good portion of my life i also want to live outside the us for a while in a country that has ancient cultural significance maybe greece or france or italy that would be the shit i feel like stretching my back always needs to be stretched after i wake up i wonder why that is ok so the timer should have reached 20 minutes by now so i will hit submit
2004_123.txt 0 1 0 0 1 ok i'm here in the cpe building during mandatory study time i'm trying to catch up on some missed work , like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which i could not do before hand because i lost my class code number well anyway , let 's see what 's on my mind the mets are really bad i have actually begun rooting against them so they will fall into last place and art howe will be fired he really is an awful manager personally , i liked bobby valentine sure he had a couple rough moments , but overall he was a much more effective manager hmmm well my friend scott neff , who used to work for the mets , sat down with jim duquette the other day and jd pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for art howe they have begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse for example the wizard , the wiz , and the grandfather there was a little bit of a pause there because i took a swig of water i'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what i'm writing is that a little bit disconcerting yes oh well i'm glad i will be taking advantage of this time 3 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track i just turned my cell phone off james has handwriting that 's hard to understand my battery life remains surprisingly high wireless internet is pretty awesome wow this is the first time i have used wireless internet i wonder how long i have been typing probably 8 or 9 minutes which means that i should probably stop around 8 56 i wonder what i'm going to have to do after 11 pm i should have brought those quarters i knew i should have but then i would have been late i have got this compulsion for grammatical correctness is that weird well , i talked to my mom today she and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today that 's sick my dads had that car since before i left for school that 's over a month now and he has not even taken the roof down ! ! ! he spent 70 grand almost on a convertible and does not even bother to take the roof down ! tell me that 's not a disgusting waste someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet i wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going i thought id miss it a little bit and i kind of do i miss the actual acting aspect of it but you ca not imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all it should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit it must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside or maybe it will just bring back weird memories my finger no my thumb really itches i'm thinking i should wash my hands they feel pretty grimy i did wash them after i ate that sushi though the sushi was surprisingly good on the other hand it should be good if its 8 the smell in the room well there is no distinguishable smell back in jester though wow that place smells incredibly bad it 's always a mixture of body odor , popcorn and some sort of lysol really nasty i wonder how lauren is doing i really like that girl , but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend sexually , she is pretty frustrating i assume all mormons are but when i have numerous girls around me who are much more um liberal sexually , it makes me think twice more often than i would like i wonder what she thinks of me that situation with tyler is fu messed up i'm sure she knows that but now that i think of it that whole thing is pretty messed up oh well someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet he 's walking over to someone whispering in his ear smiling oh well i think my battery life is running low i think my 20 mins is up
2004_124.txt 0 0 1 1 1 i just finished taking the prescreening survey and i could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive i'm not even sure that i will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if i'm qualified i do not feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser , i guess i have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday , and i surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it i feel alright talking to people , but somehow it 's different typing my feelings onto a screen this screen represents nothing to me right now , i do not know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this somehow i'm still making sure that i am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar anyway , the event that i found out about yesterday involves losing a person that i knew in high school i ca not stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls , and now one of us is not here it 's very clear in my mind that we were not the best of friends , but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well i personally have not spoken or seen her since graduation , but i knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else now that i think about it ( and i ca not stop thinking about it ) she is one of the most brilliant people i have met in my life she graduated 5th in our class , and spent this past summer at princeton for a research project definitely someone who was going somewhere i never thought that something like this could happen to one of us , the people that basically built the foundation for the person that i am today i know we were not the closest that friends could be , but my best friends are wrecks right now , and that affects me it 's a direct and indirect effect , not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing , but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me i'm tangled and i'm not sure where this leaves me i hate that i ca not remember the last thing that we said to each other nevertheless i was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world , and i was off in mine , both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world it 's not fair that her life was not complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do it 's not fair that they found her the way that they did it 's not fair that we do not know and we wo not know for a long time the truth of what happened everything is so complex i ca not call anyone i mean , i can call , but i do not know what i could say that would offer any comfort it would be different if i were there with our friends , must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands nobody here at ut went to my high school , and i doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew i feel alone , i feel helpless , but at the same time i feel like i'm connected to everyone else who knew her because , well , we are all probably feeling alone right now college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves , become good individuals in this world at the same time , in the time between our high school graduation and now , we have all become isolated from each other it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious all time in the world is precious now things that i was worried about before i heard the news , any stress that i felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared homework and little things seem trivial to me in a way things seem simplified now we either are or we are not just being here does not seem right but is it selfish to be so so glad that i am here i wonder if i deserve it , or if i can earn my place here then again , who knows if it 's so bad on the other side i see that i have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular , and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as i press finish , yet for them to linger in my mind still any other day i would have felt that this assignment was worthless , but i will admit it feeling like a part of myself is being put out there a huge or small risk , i'm not sure makes me feel the slightest bit better maybe
2004_125.txt 0 1 0 0 1 well , i'm really not thinking about anything in particular except for the fact that i know i have to do this just got back from school and had lunch my whole apartment smells of black pepper chicken spicy stuff , but yummy i cooked it last night , ah the life of a college student i have left the tv on i always like to watch something as i eat something to entertain , or dull and numb the mind it 's been a good week , but everything has passed so fast i have always wondered about the concept of time how it can feel so simultaneously fast and slow at the same time i have the worst memory but it was not always the case i'm not getting old so much as i had a lot of problems after being involved in a hit and run accident a few years ago headaches and a somewhat irrational fear of cars i was in a car accident a few days ago , on my way to san marcos to do some shopping my boyfriend was driving , the roads were wet and a car rammed us from behind what a nasty shock ! at least no one was hurt , definitely not a major accident i left the tv on way too loud funny how i sometimes like to be in a roomful of silence , and others i love background noises leave the tv on just for company talk about true desperation csi is on love the show absolutely fascinating i am such a tv addict , a skilful channel surfer , a couch potato with well developed curves my belly and bottom got an exam coming up on monday , got to start studying for that hope it 's not too tough gosh , i really miss home and family it 's tough being away in a foreign land i ca not wait to get back to sydney and singapore i am so looking forward to my trip in europe at the end of the year i am so excited about vienna and italy i love to travel but things are always so different when you are actually living in a country it was hot out today i will need to buy a fan for my apartment the ceiling fan just does not cut it i'm glad i missed most of summer , ca not stand the heat like winter so much better i'm hoping to see and play with lots of snow in europe have to admit that i do not really know what else to talk about i just know that i want to shower after this but knowing me , i will probably end up lazing on the couch and watching more of the csi marathon have to go pack my stuff later so i can continue the moving process my new apartment needs a lot of tlc before it will be in tip top shape then again , only about three more months till i leave the states and am back on the road to canada , europe , asia then australia this year has been a most trying one but i know that i am a stronger and wiser person for it i have been through so much in life , but i know there 's so much more i'm really hoping to have some time to visit my cousin in harvard before i leave and a family friend in new york my body 's cooling down , feeling a little chilly now maybe i wo not need want that fan after all there 's no need for it but wants are the way the world works i am almost there , just 2 more minutes left i really need to focus my time and attention on what i'm doing because of all the surrounding noises i'm actually speaking as i type is that normal or more precisely , that 's normal for me i wonder what professor pennebaker would say about what it means when people talk a fair amount to themselves , out loud ok back to csi
2004_126.txt 0 0 1 1 1 ok so i am writing about my thinking well tonight was interesting i had a great time at the phi lamb meeting laura was really sweet i hope that i will get to know her better i wonder who my big sister will be in phi lamb hmm interesting i love big sisters in organizations which is kind of crazy because i just talked to my big sister from the drill team i was a part of in high school random even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me i promise when i have kids they will never be more than like three years apart i ca not believe that in ten years i will probably be married with kids and all that oh my gosh where has the time gone i am actually excited about being a mom my mom was amazing she may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her no one can argue like her that 's for sure i miss her but i will see her this weekend i ca not believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game it is crazy i ca not wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home which is totally crazy i never thought i would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast but i guess that is a good thing i will be here for four years so i should probably make it feel like home so now that my boyfriend calls i am thinking about him i ca not believe i am doing this whole long distance relationship thing it is the hardest thing in the world i miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late october i wonder if we will make it i know we can but it is so crazy four years of being six hours apart i wonder what we would be like married it would be amazing to be his wife he is the most amazing guy i have ever known everything i could ask for he has but still i get scared sometimes i wish i could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him i guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away i also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which would not be good for either of us i believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if i had him there with me all the time anyways wow it is already eleven i really like this song i had never really listened to jack johnson but it is very relaxing i wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now i like this one too it kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why i like it so much i wish we had a tv though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger which is great but i do not know whatever tomorrow is thursday i do not really like thursdays my classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok i guess i had a lot of homework for tomorrow college is a lot different than high school in workload like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy i guess its good that i am typically an overachiever well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me but whatever i hope tomorrow goes by fast i ca not wait till friday i get to go out on a boat that is going to be so much fun and then saturday is the football game i ca not wait for that i have never been to a ut game so it is definitely going to be an experience wow it has been twenty minutes i guess i am done ok bye
2004_127.txt 1 1 0 0 0 yeah so i am so stressed right now and i am wishing that i would not have eaten that popcorn because eating is not exactly that best reaction to stress i could get fat ! ! ! i do not want to be fat i mean i know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school ! right ! ! but i am trying to run a lot ! ! ! ! that way , i can burn stress and burn calories extra calories ! ! ! i am having a hard time not getting irritated when i eat a lot that 's weird huh ! that it 's when i am hungry that i'm not most irritable hmmmm well today when i went running , i realized that i should have stretched because it 's going to be hard to continue running everyday when i'm tight and get this ! i have lost 5 lbs since i got to school but how ! ! i have been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running ! oh well still i was kind of excited ! but i am mad that i have not started my period yet my mood swings are terrible and so are again my eating patterns ! and that 's when i find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something i do not like spanish ! ! ! ugh ! i want to move to spain and learn it by living with people who speak it ! but i really do not want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows english so she is slow to interpret and yet teach does she really think that if she say 's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh i have heard that word before and oh i know what it means ! poof ! i mean we have to learn something before we can know it did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her mother 's womb no ! she was pottied trained right ! well my high school spanish teacher was horrible and i had the worst experience with that while i got a great grade , i did not learn that much which was really disappointing ! ! ! i mean i am glad i got an a but she did not prepare me for ut where my prof speaks in spanish all the time not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it ! would i say to a baby ok this is how you open your mouth open it open it do you know what i am saying ! ! it kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who ca not speak english well they are not trying to be mean but they may say hey how are you really loudly and you are like dude , they are not deaf ! they just do not know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone right ! ! grr so i feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like man this girl is so negative ! golly , i am right now because i see my spanish prof everyday ! like i said before so yeah ! uhhhhh well i am excited about this weekend but at the same time i keep thinking of how behind i am compared to everyone else here at ut , intellectually and academically ! i mean i feel so insignificant some times however i know where i get my wisdom from and that is jesus christ who makes my knowing god possible ! he saved me from the depths of hell ! and even after doubting him so much and having to research jesus' life and creation and all that i have found that he is the one he is my sufficiency ! i mean who knows more than the god of the universe , the creator of the heavens and i am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly mentally , emotionally , spiritually , and intellectually ! i mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the god that came to live like us at a point in time ( point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years ) there is just so much opposition to him right now i mean there always has been obviously ( that 's why he was put to death well actually god let him die as a sacrifice for us ! ) but i just want everyone else to know his love and i really do not feel the need to push it off on anyone in a bible beating manner but just to love them through how i treat them hopefully i was not too negative for you know what i'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this please look for jesus with the pre suppositions that he does not exist expect to find him and i know you will ! to his glory alone !
2004_128.txt 1 1 1 1 1 ok so i'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird , but then again i love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking so this is kind of fun i just wish that my strep throat tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow ( thursday ) i can do well in the challenge and so that i can play well for the clarinet sectional friday night , because i need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally , i have not memorized all of it yet i guess it comes from being an alternate , because half the time we practiced pregame ( which has not been much ) i was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch oh boy , do not i love watching i really hate just sitting there as an alternate , because i feel like i'm a cheap addition to the band like i was not quite good enough to deserve a marching spot but on the flip side , they must think that i'm good enough because i'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick , late , drunk , or too hungover to march i feel bad for thinking this but i kind of want kelvin 's knee to keep him from marching on saturday maybe he will have me march pregame for him , since taps stride is a lot more painful i do not want to wish that pain on him , though , because he 's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game plus he 's a 5th year and he does not have many more games left thank god this room has finally warmed up or maybe its because i put some pants on do i smell smoke that would not be good maybe gina and i should not leave the towels over the vent even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning ! ! holy cow you would think its january , not september ! man , sleeping over at rustic 's place last weekend was awesome i was warm the entire night , and when i got hot i just kicked the covers off until i got cold i guess the fact that i was wearing his pajama pants helped no nothing happened he 's a really good guy a christian his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex it has to deal with a unicorn yeah i wont go into details but it proves that he 's a good guy not to mention i spent both friday and saturday nights at his place he did not try a single thing ! funny how dad thinks i trust guys too much , and make myself too 'available' if only he knew me better , he would know that i'm very skeptical with guys especially after so many of them lying to me i'm sick of being cheated on and lied to , so i basically play hard to get i do not think id consider it that , but i do not go easy on them i'm not the stupid blonde you think i am i really wish i was one or two steps up on the ladder my whole life i felt like i was not quite good enough i never won any student council positions , never quite made it to area band , made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester , made alternate up here at ut , and was not elected as newman representative i do not understand it i work my ass off to do the best i can , but that never seems to be good enough why my dad was valedictorian at his high school , and if i had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go why did i all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade granted mrs glover refused to help me , and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems , but still i did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra , and then algebra and geometry in high school but once i hit algebra 2 and precal , shit hit the fan i just hope i do not have to take calculus in college but since i do not know what i want to do , i may have to i really need to get that career test done i have got to figure out what i want to do with myself by next semester unless i stay in liberal arts , this whole semester has practically been a waste not quite , because bio psy and band count ( for nursing at least ) , but other than that i do not know what i want to do what do people do if they ca not decide take a lot of random classes i guess , but that 's not me i'm coming in with so many hours that i was hoping to graduate in 3 years that way if i go to law school i can get in and out before i'm 30 , ugly , and still single i hope i meet someone up here i'm not built to be single or to date for years to come ahh nose needs to stop itching why the heck do i have to be sick i hate this ! once hell week was done i got sick yeah , that makes the first week of school start off real good let me tell you oh well at least i did all the partying last weekend , before all the symptoms hit and before my parents decided to come in dangit !

2004_129.txt 1 1 0 1 1 it 's only the second week of school , actually the first full week and i'm already so stressed out from studying i'm not sure exactly how to study but i'm learning i think maybe i should just make study guides so that 's what i'm doing oh my gosh , i got to eat at the nicest restaurant last night , trueluck 's it was so good and i had such a good time this past saturday i wanted to go home so bad and was trying to get my boyfriend to come meet me in waco to eat it did not happen but in the long run i'm glad because i finally made some friends i'm the kind of person who likes to have a lot of friends to hang out with and usually they are mostly guys though this does not much help my boyfriend 's peace of mind i'm not sure my roommate is that way but whatever anyway , well i met these really cool guys who i really like hanging out with sometimes i do not think ashley likes them as much and it pisses me off because it makes me feel like she thinks i'm wrong to hang with guys because i have a boyfriend and so does she and well we are just really different well these guys ended up needing dates to a dinner for their fraternity so we said we would go , i think ashley only said yes because she had been drinking well i had so much fun and the guy i went with turned out to be really nice it was great to finally go out and do something with people i feel more at home now now to my boyfriend we were best friends for 2 years before we even thought about dating i love him so much and although i'm only 18 i pretty much believe he 's the guy i'm suppose to be with when i get married but my going away to college has been hard on both of us and in some ways harder on him i understand that he 's back home and doing the same things he 's done for 3 years so he does not have as many things to keep his mind of missing me as i do but before we never argued and now he 's always mad at me about something he makes me feel awful when i go out and i know he does not mean to but it happens he ca not understand where i'm coming from the guy i dated never cried every night and now he does and it gets depressing and makes me feel guilty i want to have fun here without knowing that he 's at home mad or crying he 's not the crying type of guy so i just do not understand i love him more than anything and he should realize that , that is all that matters no other guy here will ever take his place but that does not mean that i wo not make other guy friends and go out with them i do not even look at guys the same way because of brent my life here does not mean that what i feel in my heart is suddenly going to change i just wish that he would go back to being the same brent as before i left but i know that it is going to take time and i just need to realize this just as much as he needs to realize how bad he 's making me feel it 's a compromise situation but i think everyone should have to go through this because if we are still together in the long run i know our relationship will be just that much stronger i'm going home this weekend and i ca not wait finally i can show brent that my feelings for him are the same and i get to see my mom and sister i have to go to my dad 's and since he just moved out a few weeks ago it will be my first time to go and i'm not really looking forward to it i want things to go back to normal with my family the way it 's suppose to be if there is such a thing the months before coming to college were so hard and stressful that at times i'm glad i'm here and away from all of it at least i do not have to listen to the screaming and fighting i wish my mom would try to fight for my dad and like lose weight or something but she 's being stupid i miss my sister so much and my dog tinker my sister and i are so close we might as well be twins so i hate being away from her

2004_132.txt 1 1 1 1 0 yesterday , i went tubing with my family on the guadalupe river it was a blast ! it was the first time since i moved to college on ague 20th that i have spent time with my mom and sister they are the two people that i miss the most back home and i was so happy and relaxed to get to spend time with them i also got to see my little baby puppy bichon frise named bebe who is absolutely spoiled rotten it was weird going home and sleeping in my own bed for a night but it was also a great get away from school to just hang out with my family i guess that i have been putting off any kind of homesickness by staying busy with school and trying to meet as many people as possible i find that the more that i see my family the more i think about them and get sad so i am refraining from going home for just that reason i am waiting to find out if i am going to get an interview from the texas spirits and i have mixed feelings on whether or not i want to join part of my does not want to be joining an organization i am not 100 interested just because i am looking to meet some new cool people , but on the other hand i need to get involved in something at ut so that i can find so sense of belonging in this large school i definitely am worried that if i get busy with an organization i would overstress about my classes and meeting the clubs requirements as a member deep down i know that most of my worries are pretty trivial compared to most peoples problems i know that i am very lucky just to get the chance to go to college and that is why i am so concerned on whether or not i am going to blow it i am very concerned about my chemistry class and i have been thinking about how much i need to study all weekend well , two classes ago we discussed on a scale from 1 10 , what is your fear of death my feels like it is 20 this is not because i lack a faith that their is a higher being or an after life , it is because i am afraid of losing someone i care about while i am away at school i have been thinking a lot about a friend of mine who was going to be a sophomore at ut this year who passes away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism clot i am now grieving the loss of someone so young and so beautiful that i feel that my sense of security has been ripped away from me i am now thinking if someone so healthy and young can lose their life so suddenly , whose to say that the could not be my brother sister or mother father i guess that you could say that i am one of those people who worry to much and i worry that i will lose someone again and i would not have had the chance to say goodbye anyways , this all sounds so childish and heavy for an 18 year old college student to be thinking about well i am so happy that these 20 min have flown by and i can get to my real homework it really felt go to get all of my thoughts out in a way that was quick and easy i hope that i can get all of my work done tonight so that i do not get behind this week this was a great assignment , i would not mind doing more of these have a great day !
2004_133.txt 0 1 1 0 0 i feel so blessed to be here right now the game tonight was so fun i ca not believe that we won 65 0 that 's such an incredible win poor north texas guys they must feel pretty embarrassed i feel so content here and settled even though i have only been here a couple of weeks i think that i am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home i miss judd so much the time we get to spend together is never enough its funny to me how i have not missed my parents at all but i think about and miss judd all the time i just love the way he makes me feel , so warm and so complete i'm so glad that i have friends here like oshley and that i totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate i'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we are still good friends i was so surprised when i saw him on the jumbotron tonight i feel so proud of him i ca not stop thinking about how lucky i feel to be here i just love it here and ca not wait till judd gets here i think i want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here its just so amazing the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing living in new braunfels was such a bubble this feels more like the real world i know that people say college is still a bubble and i think they are right , but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels i miss high school , but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown at the game last night , i felt a little sad that i was not down there on the track cheering now that judd and i were together , part of me wishes i could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader it would have been so much fun to have that sort of experience ! i'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because i feel like they are not taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they have got down there those were the best times of my life thus far i know that better are sure to come in my years here at texas , but i just wish that i could go back , just for one friday night , and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd it makes me so sad that i probably wo not ever get to perform like that again my dancing and cheering days are over and i just want them back its not that i miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program , i just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans i thrive off of that and now i feel a little empty since i do not get to do it anymore , and i especially feel it when i see the new girls down there on the track i feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that i'm in college because all i ever talked about in high school was how i could not wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student granted i definitely do not miss the drama of high school , i do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading the more i keep thinking about this the more sad i feel i think the biggest problem is how much i miss judd we spent so much time together this summer and i just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever i needed him i ca not believe i fell in love with him he 's just an amazing guy the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his christianity its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and i was too young to question it and now its just a part of who i am and i'm so thankful for that but judd did not grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he ca not prove really is there i think its a matter of pride the idea of giving himself to someone else that he does not really know is there does not settle well with him or maybe its a trust issue or maybe both its just hard because i ca not really understand how he can not have belief , and he does not understand how i can oh man i have a lot of homework this weekend i really have to finish it all tomorrow so i can go home and see judd i ca not wait to see him tomorrow i wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me i ca not wait for him to come to school up here and be with me ! that will totally complete me here i do not know if i'm complete without him i have never felt dependent on someone like that before well i think my time is almost up in conclusion , i feel so amazed that i'm actually here i miss my friends who are not here , and i especially miss judd i want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer
2004_134.txt 1 1 0 1 0 well where should i start first of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that i have ever had to do i'm not even sure what to write about my day started at 6 30 today because i have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun not as fun as this class but fun non the less then i went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun then i had a break from 10 to 3 30 which would really suck if i did not have plans so after my class i went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a i'm flag football team well anyway , i'm not even sure if i'm doing this assignment right because all i am doing is describing what i did today any way i really enjoyed today 's material in class at first i was not sure if i would like the class but now i really believe that it might be my favorite class right now considering that i have and extremely hot instructor for my rhe 306 class its crazy hot attractive she is but now i'm thinking about another girl that i have a crush on today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates i'm not sure if she knows how i feel , but i'm having a hard time reading her usually i'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which does not make things any easier i also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because i had been wanting to talk to them for a while things seem to be really good between us which is not too surprising because we are all pretty decent guys , though one does tend to get to us sometimes i am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind on yeah , i got to talk to my parents today which was not too bad my dad did not say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work my mom called on her way to a bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl i have crush on this weekend since she is going home friday anyway crush is such a high school word now , what i really meant was girl i'm attracted to what 's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since i was in 10th grade and every time she would tell me i would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that i'm into her it kind of sucks because now i have to put much more effort into it now do not get me wrong , because i'm not trying to make it seem like i'm am lazy but i truly am not used to putting in so much work i know it may sound cockeye but if it does i'm sorry , please do not think of me like that what 's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we will talk later , or i will type and you will read later
2004_136.txt 0 1 1 0 0 well today i went with my friend kai to his texas crew orientation he tried to get me to join , but i just do not think that crew would be the sport for me i prefer to play volleyball above all other sports just this past week , i signed up for the volleyball teams here at ut i would really enjoy to play for the school , or at least on a team , competing with others i used to play volleyball every weekend with my family back in houston , i guess that 's why i like it so much i miss being around my family , but i know that they are proud of me for being here at ut i wanted to go back this weekend , since it 's a 3 day weekend , unfortunately , i am a little behind in my classes , so i wanted to take advantage of this time to catch up and maybe get ahead a little the reason which i am behind in my classes , which is so unlike me , is probably because i am having trouble reading and concentrating at the same time i believe that this is happening because of the long summer well just now my ex boyfriend instant messaged me , which for some reason i have been avoiding i guess because i do not want anything to do with him , i do not even consider him a good friend just now , my friend whom which i met through hang out , a gay organization here on campus , instant messaged me asking me to go out he has been taking me out , to places i would not even think of going , since i arrived here at ut now him i do consider him a good friend he is a really good guy , really fun to be around with i do not know if i am starting to develop feelings for him , which would not be a good thing at all since he is about to leave the school i spent last night at his house , just hanging out , talking about whatever came to our minds , and fell asleep on his bed nothing happened , but for some reason , i sort of wanted something to i believe that i wanted something to happen because i have been feeling very lonely these past few days , maybe because of i need a boyfriend , or the whole owing the bank money and not having any to give , or not going home for the weekend or maybe i just genuinely like him well i guess we will soon find out because my scholarship check arrived at my house in houston 2 days ago , and my mom is going to mail it to me , and if all goes as planned , i will be able to keep the money for myself , if financial aid allows me to so i will use that money to pay off my bank bill and today , my mom called , and i felt like i was there even though we are 3 hours away , which took away my wanting to go there for this weekend right now , i do not want a boyfriend for various reasons one , i have decided to put off sex until i get tested for hiv i do not have suspicions that i may have it , but i have had unprotected sex , and so i just want to be sure second , i need to stay focused on my school work , and having a boyfriend may distract me third , i just do not know if i can handle going through what i went through with my ex all over again not that it would necessarily happen again , but i just do not want to take the risk or maybe i should just be brave and take a risk i need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision
2004_139.txt 0 1 0 0 0 as i sit in this library for the first time in my entire life , i feel as if i do not belong here , in this setting i'm not usually the completely studious type so i'm just trying this library thing out it 's really deathly quiet and i'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me i feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting i hope people around me are not annoyed by this tapping as i am i'm sitting alone in the corner , but at least i'm next to the window i picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored people watching is fun it 's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story , their own point of view and i often wonder how different it is from my own i have not had any quiet time or alone time to myself since i have moved up here to austin and just now , i realize that i indeed do miss it i think i will visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on next time , i should remember to bring a jacket i feel like i'm turning into a humansicle but i do not like walking all the way from my dorm to here it 's quite a walk i really should learn how to use the bus system here i'm used to having the comfort of my car the comfort i have had for four years i miss it i went home this weekend , the very first weekend after school started it 's not because i missed home or i was homesick or anything i have been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much like this summer , my 5 weeks overseas , i do not think i even thought about my family or home life all that much as horrible as that sounds , i'm not the type to miss my family or anything anyway , i just went home this weekend because i felt that my dorm room was too bland and i wanted to bring up more stuff i ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that i should have thrown away instead , this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area it looks so much better i also got a new webcam my mother had one at home that i wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one my mother 's a funny person she came to the states during her college years about 20 something years ago i wonder how her college experience was it must have been hard i can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you are saying i have experienced it still , she managed pretty well , i suspect she 's just that type of person she has a really strange accent though in her english normally , asian people have a really fobbish horrible sounding accent but she has a peculiar twang to it to make it sound incredibly different it 's not a perfect english accent but it sounds slightly european i do not know why my mom is a very peculiar person oh , going back to the webcam thing i think one day i was using her computer at home and i looked at her picture folder there were all these webcam shots of her smiling and trying to look cute in several different outfits i almost fell out of my chair laughing my mom is so cute i believe she chats more than i do online to her friends we have never chatted before but now that i'm not home , we have started to talk online through msn messenger it 's incredibly awkward and a strange experience but i'm sure i will be accustomed to it soon my mom 's awesome i wonder how many of my friend 's moms chat online to them no one well , no one that i have met anyway now i have run out of things to say so i'm slowly gazing around this room i'm next to a beigish wall i do not think i enjoy the color beige too much i wish i had better posture typing on the computer makes me slouch sitting back while reading makes me slouch eating makes me slouch i think i'm just a natural sloucher i want to grow at least two more inches though i look taller if i would stand up straight but it 's so hard i also heard stretching makes you taller i should try that sometime i always say i will start things and never do or usually i start things that i never finish i wonder if it 's a kind of disorder there are a lot of books on the shelf that look amazingly old i should go flip through some of them before i leave they look interesting i like that old book smell i do not know why it will probably make me sneeze someone just walked past me and we both sort of glanced at each other i should have smiled or something i feel so rude and mean i think i look mean when i feel emotionless or i'm not making any faces on purpose my mom says asians naturally look angry all the time maybe it 's true i should smile more often but then i feel like an idiot if someone sees me just smiling to myself oh well it 's college now , i'm sure nobody cares and there are weirder people than me here anyway time 's up , i'm done

2004_141.txt 0 1 1 1 0 so yesterday my boyfriend from a m came down to austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary it was a lot of fun but i stayed up late so i'm pretty tired i hate that feeling of no energy and i just want to sleep but i know i ca not because i am so stressed out i am still really adjusting to college life it 's is so different from high school and its not all that it 's worked up to be i really like all the freedom , along with everyone else , but i am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying i am only taking 14 hrs , which is supposedly and easy load , but i feel so bogged down i tell myself i am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up i have so much i want to do but there are not enough hours in the day but everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust i just do not hope it will reflect in my grades i thought i had a calculus test next friday , but i came to find out today that it is nest wednesday that is really scary bit i took calculus my senior year in high school so i feel i know some of the stuff everyone studies hardcore for tests , which i am pretty nervous about i do not really do to much homework in that class because i have so much to do in my other classes i really hope i'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student does not type super fast so my paper looks really short and that i did not try anyways , i have a problem with the nest football game which is tx vs rice i did not realize they sold the tickets so early i guess the draw started yesterday i want to go but i have not really met a lot of close friends to go with this guy friend from high school wants me to go but i really want to go with a big group of people i have never been to a large football game actually the only games i have gone to have been my high school games but my high school had like 3 , 000 people so it was a big school a lot of the seniors from our school went to a m because it 's only an hour away i do not know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this i am originally from california , which was so pretty , and houston is not the prettiest place in the world i forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me it is getting really annoying seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now i like it but some people are obsessed with it but i guess i am obsessed with my cell phone i do not even use any other phone i am always on it i think it is so funny when you walk to class and everyone is on their cells i feel like i have to take mine to and call someone so of course i do plus , walking to class gets kind of lonely i feel like these thoughts pop in my head and i then i go in a tangent to try to type but then my mind goes blank for a second i never really thought i was a good writer in fact , i thought i was horrible my teachers never gave me feedback and i never felt comfortable sharing my papers in class it was not until the end of my senior year , my english teacher told the whole class that i was one of the best writers in the class i really thank her for that because that really boosted my confidence and i feel like i do write well it almost makes me look forward to writing instead of procrastinating like i do everything else my critical thinking teacher said that is the number one regret for students after their first semester i believe him because it is so hard not to procrastinate i try not to since it 's such a bad thing , but i guess it 's just human nature

2004_152.txt 1 0 0 1 1 as i am writing this , the red sox are playing the a 's i think this really may be the year for the sox i hope so because how cool would it be to see the curse of the bambino broken their lineup is killer this year , and they are finally playing the game the way it 's supposed to be played defense and pitching they look like the 1996 2001 yankees i'm ready for a world championship for my sox i just read an email from home , from my dad i miss him , just having someone around to talk to i guess i am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad that i do , most guys do not i mean , not many people have the kind of dad who taught them how to play sports and things like that , but i have vivid memories of being 8 and 9 years old and my dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the ferry with football season starting , i really realize how much i miss the game i mean , it 's been 6 years since i didn't play football during the fall , and it is kind of hitting hard i miss putting on the pads , taking the hits , the excitement of friday nights , being the captain i miss d a lot too we had such a crazy fall last year , always know that we should be together but never being able to get it right i miss 8th periods with her , driving around in my jeep and talking i miss saturdays , the days after games hanging out and eating hoagies , watching football with micah i have been gone 3 weeks , and i'm not homesick , i'm just kind of missing the crew i miss meghan a lot for 4 years , she 's been one of the biggest things in my life , and i really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that i am one of the biggest things in her life too which is good , because i really cannot see either of us drifting away from the other i hope andrew is doing ok i'm sure he is , such a small school is good for him he really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention for being the big guy , the built guy a school like this would be terrible for his self esteem but oh well , whatever floats your boat , right i really hope micah does ok that kid has never been in a social group or circle that i did not bring him into he may really struggle with finding his niche at school i hope not thought , he 's my best friend and i need him to be self confident and happy so i can stop worrying about him i can never really tell if worrying about people is a good thing or a waste of time i worry so much about meghan , with her mother walking out on her and everything and meghan is so reclusive when it comes to her emotions , even to me it betrays her every once in a while thought , when i have a beautiful , crying girl in my arms , and it 's almost satisfying to see a basic human reaction emotion out of her i hope d is doing ok being the only one of us not to go to college has to take it 's toll on her but from what she says , she is getting her act together i just could not take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy as lee thank god she 's finally going in the right direction maybe i wo not have to live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road somewhere of course , if it was going to be anyone who did , it would be me going away has finally moved people to express themselves , and it really does making me feel satisfied that i am having an impact in someone 's life or , a lot of someone 's i really do not mean that to sound arrogant , it 's just that i invest so much of myself into those people and i really believe it has paid off my family seems to being doing well i'm glad the girls will be back in school soon , and next year maggie will be in my position that 's crazy go sox
2004_153.txt 1 1 0 0 1 today was pretty rough my bio test was incredibly hard and i do not know yet what to think about that chemistry quiz i just took i have got this spot on the top of my foot that is rubbed raw from my cheap flipflops i'm really hungry i wonder if we will go out to eat tonight or just go to the cafeteria i only have one class tomorrow , thank goodness i need a break from school but i find it hard to concentrate on work there 's so much more to do around here my roommate is never around but i do not mind because my suitemates are awesome i do not know what to put in this thing tyler came to visit me for labor day we are not 'together' but we are still really good friends maybe sometime we will be but i do not want a serious relationship right now esp not a long distance one tulsa is not that far but it 's still a trek esp since i do not have a car i have to get a 3 8 to even consider getting into med school i hope that bio test did not just screw me over everyone 's like oh it 's only your first semester but i do not have time to screw up my family does not accept failure my parents were both brilliant and so is my older brother i guess if i screw up it will give the younger 5 kids a little breathing room give them an opportunity to be 'average' and not feel bad about it my main problem is procrastination notice how i'm writing this 'paper' the day before it 's due not to say that i have not had a lot going on because studying for that test was definitely important 20 minutes is pretty long when you think about it i can be on the phone for 2 hours straight with no problem , but just typing for 5 is already killing me i hope psychology is one of my easier classes i took it because it interests me and i needed some sort of break from my math and science courses i have been really stressed and i eat junk all of the time i think i will go running tonight but i have worn all of my sophie shorts around the dorm so they are dirty and i have not done laundry yet i have never done laundry before and it kind of freaks me out my mom has been a stay at home mom my whole life so she did all of the little things pack my lunch , make after school snacks , organize the family 's schedule it was pretty rough trying to organize everything when all 7 of us kids lived at home but she always managed as i earlier stated , she 's brilliant my dad works for shell not like at the gas station or anything but downtown houston he does computer stuff and that 's the extent of my knowledge about his job except that he 's an it manager and yeah veronica is making popcorn and it smells so good my blinds are closed so they leave streaks of light across my keyboard and monitor it 's annoying but peaceful at the same time i have road rage so i guess it 's a good thing i do not drive around here too many pedestrians and bad drivers i would probably get an ulcer or get shot for screaming at the wrong person i want ice cream or pizza we had mcdonalds yesterday daron thinks their food is gross but i love it sarah and meghan were going to do dancing sometime i think this weekend so that will be fun i suck and dancing , but whatever who really care there 's a quote i like those who care are not important and those who are important do not care ) i love that my other favorite quote is a life of love will have some thorns but a life without love will have no roses that 's helped me through relationships and crap my sister erica taught me that quote she 's cute looks just like me ! ha just kidding she 's a senior in high school and it would be awesome if she came to ut next year but she wants to go to a small east coast college or to a mormon one in the utah idaho region wherever she goes she will be great my older brother , bryant , is serving a church mission in italy but he will be back at ut in 2 years kevin is probably one of the smarter of my brothers he 's in high school and wants to be an architect ( sp ) then there 's kara she made the volleyball team ( 7th grade ) and i'm so proud of her i tried out when i was her age and did not make it because i sucked and then i was too embarrassed to try out in 8th grade , which i regret steven just started middle school i'm worried about him because he 's such a little , sweet kid he 's completely sarcastic and hilarious , but you have to get to know him or he does not talk much shannon is the baby of the family and my mom said she 's just like me ha ha poor kid but she 's loud and obnoxious and does not take crap from anyone she 's funny and flirty and has all kinds of friends at school i used to be completely shy so i'm so proud of her for being the outgoing type she picks up crude phrases from me and the older kids in the house , though , and so that 's no good i like my dorm some of my friends stay in these crappy small dingy places and i do not understand why they would pay for that crap gross plus community bathrooms freak me out so i love sharing the toilet shower with just one other person 2 more minutes on this thing gosh i bit off my nails the other day and so now they hurt which does not help when i'm typing long papers for psychology do grammar and punctuation and sentence structure really matter for this assignment i sure hope not i figure it 's not english class and since i'm fairly good at keeping my grammar understandable , i should be fine 10 seconds !

2004_163.txt 0 1 0 1 0 today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what it 's only the 4th day of classes that 's a horrible thing to think about i stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage it 's awful i have been on some other floors and it does not smell like that i wonder if it 's the carpet or something , but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it , so that 's cool i guess i got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow i'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that yeah right this oatmeal cream pie is great , i'm so hungry because i have not eaten all day yet , and all my professors successfully fried my brain i hate when i do not know everything well i do not mean everything because nobody knows everything , but more like i hate when i ca not understand something right away , probably because i know that means i have to spend extra time learning it later on and that 's never any fun i swear that when i used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger , so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something i would not be surprised , or maybe now i'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself , instead of when i used to eat them years ago who knows or actually who cares kate just called me and she 's not going to eat until later , so guess that means i'm going to the chem review at 5 it will probably be really good for me so i should not complain , but complaining is so fun , yet so annoying all at the same time i ca not believe that i'm actually excited about going home this weekend , not for long , but i kind of feel like i'm missing out on so much in san antonio , even though i'm not i ca not wait to get some good mexican food it 's been too long what a horrible affect working at a mexican restaurant all summer had on me oh well the football game this weekend should be extremely awesome ! ! i'm so excited , my first ut football games as a student in the student section ha ha and actually i think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see , how cool i saw something on austin 's news talking about ordering the games on ppv that 's crazy i really hope that does not mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and i ca not watch them like the away games for example that would be so cool if i could get tickets to the ou game i hear that there 's nothing like it , and i'm sure that 's true but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks and assuming that you get all that taken care of you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going , meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well , pretty crazy , but i guess if all else fails i can order ir ppv for 40 bucks yeah right , that game better be on abc or something i actually called kenny today , after my first biology class he did not answer , hopefully it was because he was in class i do not know why but for some reason i really feel like he does not like me the way he did before i went down to san antonio this past weekend it 's cool i guess since i'm here and he 's there , but i do not know i wish that we would not of met , so that i would not have to deal with it but then again i do not wish that because he 's a cool guy so much like me though , it 's kind of scary i wish that i could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday , but then again if he did that i would not like him , since it 's all about the chase crazy how those things work out he 's been exceptionally mean though well just yesterday , but like he says it 's his way of flirting , but ha ha whatever i like that boy dang i just admitted it i do not like him actually i just do not know i definitely do not think we are each others types though he belongs around a much more rowdy karla type and he might just be a little too crazy for me sounds like a challenge i'm pretty hungry for like some real food , i guess i will go down to jcl in a little bit and find something , that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just did not do it for me and i'm exceptionally tired too i ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning , and i do not think it even helped me that much since i barely got a b on the homework man , i miss high school math classes everything was definitely explained so much better , so yeah needless to say i'm pretty freaked out about that , i'm actually freaked out about all my classes oh well
2004_165.txt 0 1 0 0 0 okay , i am writing this thing called stream of consciousness writing i find it hard to type right now i do not know if i should follow proper grammar my norton firewall just detected another blocked intrusion i do not like this annoying hackers why do not they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me i have 4 roommates and they are all good except for one he is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners he watches tv loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep he even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it that is so annoying and i ca not stand it right now my goodness , it has only been 3 mins i have been writing a lot of things already my arms are hurting because i ca not type for so long and i hate typing i'm not a typer , my brother and cousin are flawless typers but i am not i already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me i want to destroy this key board i want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy this is really annoying me i want to take the psych research right now but i ca not because i am not 18 yet that is a load of bullshit if u ask me ca not it be 17 what is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months a few months of extra knowledge i do not think so i hate my birthday , there is also a math midterm on my birthday , hooray for me how nice , what a nice birthday gift i have a tendency to measure how much i type i always limit myself and not going to much bec i always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and i am very lazy so i will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved like this writing assignment right now , if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal , i will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 20 minutes of my time doing nothing but write , senseless writing and i ate writing , i hate the damn typo errors , i hate now typing fluidly like others , i hate making mistakes , i hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers ! i hate this activity i am not in a very good mood right now , i kind of understand that , i wonder why is it my roommate maybe , is it this senseless activity maybe maybe its because university of texas has cut my freaking internet , no i ca not download beyond 8 gigs nooo bec u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others what do i say i say to hell with the others , what do they care if they do not really use the internet in the first place they are just wasting bandwidth on nothing this is just pathetic you guys are afraid of the recording companies , the rcaa or something like that that 's what you are afraid why do not you just leave us alone like other schools they have free internet , not this cheap limited u have to pay for internet i am just ranting away all my frustrations on this thing are not i i hope no one reads it , if u do the hell do i care ! damn it college life sucks to much reading everyone expects you to read all the chapters and expect you to understand the next day during the lecture well , tough luck , we are not that smart some people do well in lectures and some do well with books some people just can understand with the book so why do u pick on us everything you test should be on your lectures the book is just for bringing your knowledge of the subject to a more concrete manner lectures are what really is important , and you just read the book to review you do not test what u do not teach in lectures ! ! thank god i only have a few more minutes left my fingers are burning now i cannot be stuck doing the same thing for prolonged periods of time it is just not right it is so boring funny though if u come to think of it ironic i cannot stand doing a same thing for so long but i can stand doing nothing for so long what kind of person am i indolent lazy pathetic that 's what i am a person who does not want to leave his little protective sphere a controlled sphere i am afraid to do things with risks , i will never succeed in life like that doomed not to be a leader
2004_167.txt 0 0 1 1 0 i am worried about my brother , bobby , right now my mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the er she said he is okay , but they are stitching him up right now tonight i went to church with my best friend , amanda we sang a lot , which i love i'm not necessarily the best singer , but i really enjoy it all the songs we sang tonight , i knew from my church at home in plano that made me happy i also signed up for teams at church right now i am a little frustrated though because amanda and i are trying to do our art history homework , but the website wo not let me download the article i need very frustrating ! ! ! oh , i need to go wash my dishes when i'm done with this amanda and i made chili cheese dogs they were great ! ! my roommate , sijia , is not home yet , and this worries me because it is pretty late , and she should not be walking around austin alone in the dark i have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for friday on two pieces of music that i have not been able to listen to yet , which frustrates me i just found out about the assignment today school is going well though , a little stressing , but all around , it is going well all day i listened to one of the best songs i have heard in a long time called how could i the music in this song is very well played , and the lyrics are really good ( sad though ) , and the lead singer ( of oleander ) 's voice is very soft and pretty i have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper i have to write is about 20 pages long i did not get much sleep last night because i was trying to read for art history because i do not learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all i woke up early this morning to look over my math homework i wo not get much sleep tonight either amanda has music playing in the background right now , but i do not know who is singing i like the way it sounds though tonight i taught amanda how to tap dance it was interesting we went into my bathroom ( because it 's really big and has a good floor for tapping ) and i taught her a few basics she and i have both danced our entire lives , but she has never taken tap , so i am going to teach her she is going to teach me pointe , because i have not done ballet in three years i have a bad knee , and last summer i had knee surgery , so i have not been able to do very many classes the last few years i only took tap and jazz i miss ballet though since i have moved to austin , i have really missed dance because i do not have a dance studio here i would like to go take some classes , but i think it would be better to concentrate on school , at least the first semester , and i can just practice at home i bought new pointe shoes the other day we had to walk many many miles to get them today in geology class , we played football and sang the ut fight song standing up with the hook 'them sign in the air it was a very interesting class right now i wonder if anyone has imed me on aim i'm really tired , but i wo not be able to sleep tonight because i need to do school work my parents might go to the bahamas in a few weeks , hopefully i may go as well i have not been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab ( for the knee ) , and this summer we were just too busy that reminds me , i miss my family in virginia maybe i can fly out there this summer that would be fun virginia is beautiful the chesapeake area especially i'm glad my brother is alright , but when my mother called it worried me but he will be fine i cleaned the guest bathroom tonight ( i have to do chores around the house because i live in a co op ) tomorrow i think i'm going to sleep in between classes i only have two discussion sections sijia just got home ! !
2004_168.txt 1 0 1 0 1 our world is pretty fucked up i have been watching and reading the news lately , and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with well not the only thing , but almost the only thing the world has enough problems with natural disasters , why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves between hurricane frances and soon to be hurricane ivan , why do we need chechen rebels , and radical terrorists , and radical governmental regimes to make things worse why is it that people ca not seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right be it a christian , a muslim , or an atheist , every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen , but also , others make excuses about it too they are religious they are unstable they are on medication they have had a hard life man fuck that people need to first take responsibility for their actions , and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what 's wrong is wrong i do not understand this blur of morals and truth how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being does not know the difference between right and wrong i suppose i will get off my soap box now , i just ca not fathom the world getting worse , and yet i know that tomorrow , will be even just a little bit worse than today the only thing i can do is try and change my own actions , my own beliefs , and hopefully lead by example so i was just reading bush has tried cocaine , while bush senior was president ha that makes me laugh , i say more power to bush , he says he 's clean , i believe him , i do not think his past should be this big of an issue , especially when he is running against john kerry i do not even want to vote , but i feel its my duty so who am i going to vote for its like picking the lesser of two evils and which one is lesser of a sob than the other one man i do not know i suppose i will vote for bush , being that this is texas but i do not know if i would feel right about that maybe i will just write in a vote i mean i know all of texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter maybe i will run for president one day naw , i doubt it , i'm not moderate enough not that i'm a radical , just that i do not think i could say things to appease one person or another i have my beliefs and damn it , i'm sticking to 'them that does not mean i'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments , but i'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes , that 's a fucked up way of doing business this feels good by the way i'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me , they are very loud and annoying i kind of want to say something to them , but then again they are very large men , and , since i'm making snap judgments , they are probably alpha males who would want to fight me so i will just let them be my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently they are a couple years older than me , and i'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her she dumped him because she did not feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together i can understand and appreciate where she 's coming from , but he was tore up about it anyway , they are here and talking about stuff , i can tell things are getting intense i did not even know they were going to be here , and technically i was here first so i suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal she will probably start crying soon , and he will just shake his head because he does not know what to do man , i feel sorry for them both he just wants to love her , be there for her and she does not want to hurt him , but she has no choice , she is not in the same place he is love is a funny thing love is a fucked up thing too i have only been in love once and i have fallen out of love once its a painful process but then again , i would not replace it it was a profitable , great , shitty , learning experience , one that i can completely support so why is it that humans love or choose to love or choose not to love i would like to be able to love someone again , that 's a good feeling to be able to call someone and just talk to them see how their day was , what they have been up to , and to know that they wanted to talk to you , and ask you about those same things i wonder what my wife will be like i wonder when i will meet her my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married i think i may be wrong , but i doubt it i think they are both in a place where they are ready to commit for the long haul that 's kind of scary hey , my brother is going to be married forever i'm going to have a sister in law maybe i will be an aunt or uncle soon now that is really weird its crazy how time moves i feel like graduation was a long time ago , but at the same time i feel like i still think and act like a 6th grader oh 6th grade , those were good days i thought i was the coolest kid in the world and at the time , i may have been right i was one cool 6th grader it rained today i love the rain , its so refreshing , so new , so clean , so pure it makes me appreciate the day that much more i have spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today reading , writing , talking , thinking , listening , all things i can support 100 though , so it has not been a wasted day in the least i ate at freebirds today too , that was so good i would say the feeling i have after i eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings i will ever have to being completely content , lacking absolutely nothing in the world because when i have finished freebirds , i do not even desire love , because i am so full and content i do not need anything else its a good feeling i'm thinking about what i'm thinking about writing if that makes sense it is supposed to be stream of consciousness , and i'm working on that , but i think that i'm thinking too much about it i have had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point , now i'm thinking too hard about writing something its ok though , because i only have like 15 seconds left maybe i will eat cookies later tonight , i bet those will good
2004_173.txt 1 0 1 1 1 o k , so now i'm writing for this assignment i'm going to turn off the music i'm listening to ok , all finished with that it was bizarre love triangle by new order , i like new order i like order in general reminds me of the balance between chaos and order i'm probably more into that than most people i know i wonder if most people think about chaos and order the fan above me feels good , generating wind my neck has been hurting a little today because last night i ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night i totally busted my ass my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and i crashed sideways with bike still in between me gave me a few bad strawberries and i hit my head pretty damn hard for a split second my world was bamn and multicolor my front door opened , it was my mom probably watering the plants this makes me comment on the fact that i still live at home , i still live at home i'm nineteen though so it is not a huge deal but i would like to have my own place but i do not have the money for that because i pay for my own tuition and books and expenses that sucks but i do feel good when i say that to other people , usually at work is when i do that i work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks , it 's called satellite cafe i got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that i could work through college and not have to worry about loans loans blow there 's the door again i keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text seven min , six seconds my dad just walked in and we had a how are you exchange things are going better with my parents and i there was a time before ut , ( i'm a transfer from acc ) where i did not really care much about things probably because i was not being challenged , except from work which i enjoyed enjoy anyway , i was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society is not watching or around the popular bob marley type stuff i have a need to use code , with this being a college assignment and all although i wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that should not , it 's probably close to zero i stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right how interesting internet , seven thirty seven pm i wish i was done now funny because i was looking forward to doing this , but i thought it would be more of a stop start thought process it seems like i'm just narrating my last couple of days i was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable and i am somewhat wish i had my own place , privacy being alone is nice at times hmm , i have to write for an entire twenty minutes i wonder if people that are slow at typing have a hard time with this my face is all rough and treated i have avg acne , not really the worst i have had i am using treatment though which helps my mom just went into the laundry room which i assumed meant she would go right across the hallway into my room and make a comment about it not being clean because i told her that i would clean it last night because i went on a bike ride instead in a few aspects that bike ride was a waste of time but for some reason i like wasting time there she goes back into the laundry room and no comment , but no inspection either i have a good view from the office room where i am typing this twenty minute thing itching my eye felt good my right arm is getting annoyed at it 's position now that i noticed that , i noticed i'm sore a bit all over my body , which made me think of going to gregory gym and how i ca not really yet because i am a gimp not really though , i could easily tough it out , i'm competitive and athletic , or use to be sucks not being a true youth , in high school where you can dick around for four years i knew i would miss high school for that reason i like when i repeat words and they are on two lines above and below each other , like when i typed the words high school and they are repeated in appearance i was so rudely interrupted by ( a ) the phone line for my dad ringing and ( b ) the twenty minute marker , which came faster than i had expected in the end ok , that was interesting , something i do not really want to do again , or do i it was nice to get stuff out in writing , or typing ok , finished
2004_174.txt 0 1 1 0 1 wow i ca not believe i waited this long to write this paper i was in a shock when i found out that this was due tomorrow deadlines motivate me more than ever i told myself that i was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but i guess getting it done is what is most important i just played some starcraft with my roommate i used to play this game with all my friends from school before war craft iii came out for the computer this game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework i would have to say this game was the devil it made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game i told them i would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting my parents somehow figured out that i started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out this was not a very good feeling well , anyway , this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago somehow , all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time this was extremely strange because i did not tell anybody about this news i tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions this aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak a few friends from houston already know i mean , what 's the big deal i do not understand why gossip can travel so fast i guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people 's lives i think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others i find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be what 's up the basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person 's life this type of conversation does not really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing you never know who 's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person i figured my actions did not speak that loud but any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other it immediately captures the center of attention i think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are this is not an easy task starting college this year has sure caused a lot of changes changes in friendship , responsibility and so on college is a good way of determining who your real friends are these are truly hard to find i knew this girl that had about 3 parties a year there would be over fifty people over at her house and she seemed to be enjoying their company but one time at lunch i saw her sitting by herself and she was by herself for a little while today too it 's crazy how things can turn right around like that well my hall is being pretty loud right now playing music or what not my friendship with existing friends have sure been tested and i think that the conversation we had strengthened our relationship we hardly ever talk about serious matters , so this was refreshing to me i hang out with a bunch of guys that are not really open to their feelings we seem like a bunch where we tell each other everything but we know that we are just buddies i mean we will be there for the other person in a heartbeat but no one really knows what the other is thinking , especially about relationships we would always give one of the guys a hard time because we found out who he liked or what not i always thought that we would support them and tell them to do what he felt but this was never the case three out of the four guys go to school here in austin but the fourth person is in san antonio i can tell he really misses the guys from high school and all of his gaming friends everyone makes fun of him about his intelligence but i feel obliged to back him up i know it 's all in fun but after a while i think it 's just mean i miss the guy too i hope he makes it to austin next year
2004_175.txt 1 0 0 1 0 i keep thinking about this white stripes song and i cannot remember the name of it so i can download it it continues to anger me its really dark in here so i should open the blinds , but i think right now there is a glare through a window and that would not be good since my computer faces it just a minute ago my keyboard was making me really mad it would freeze up and i could not type certain letters it made me so mad i wonder what ben is doing right now he was not online but i know he does not have to work today so i am curious what he is doing i called him earlier today and then when i got out of school i really miss him and i am glad i get to go home next friday i also miss my dog , rosie i wonder if she thinks about me or maybe thinks i am dead or something mom said she looked for me a little bit i ca not believe my credit card got denied that makes me so mad since mom sent the check like a week and a half ago i wonder if i can get on the website and look at my balance dad is such a cheap guy i ca not believe that he thinks i can live on 250 a month i guess i could but that would mean i could not buy everything i want and since mom is not here to take me shopping and buy stuff for me , i have to buy it for myself i just got back from walgreens and i am also getting really mad because my car is really dirtier every time i get in it there is bird crap all over it since it is under that tree i kind of like the spot and the shade , just not the crap i wonder when i will start to feel better i need to take that medicine i ca not stop coughing now and i could not in class either i bet it made the people around me hate me it feels weird to have already eaten dinner at 6 30 it kind of sucks that they serve it from 5 to 6 30 because i am used to it at like 7 30 the food here is not all that great but there is a better variety than mom makes i am so excited about going home next weekend and sleeping in my double bed it is really hard to get used to sleeping in a twin when i usually sprawl out all over the double my bed also has that poofy thing that needs to flatten out because it makes it harder to sleep bennett borrowed one of my scarves today and that also made me mad i do not mind that she borrowed it but i really wished she would have asked first some of her clothes are really ugly i think i do not know i guess that is what you get coming from podunk , tx i like her a lot but i just feel like she thinks she is hot stuff and it also pisses me off that she rushed and i did not i really would like to know how someone like her was accepted and i was not i'm not saying that she is gross or anything i just think that i should have gotten into a good one also it makes me mad and disappointed and upset all at the same time simply because i always pictured myself being in a sorority and i never expected rush to go that way at all it kind of hurts even worse since everyone on my hall has all of the decorations and all of that stuff claire also made me mad last night when she started eating all of my goldfish and stuff i have so much homework to do and all i want to do is go to sleep i feel awful because my nose is running and my throat and ears hurt , plus i keep coughing i wonder if it is just allergies or if i actually have a cold mom said she would make an appointment with dr eldredge when i go home so that he can see me if i need him to i really like him a lot more than dr audrey because he is not psycho and he is really young that makes me think of paschal and fort worth because his office is down that way man i really want to go to ol south i really am kind of homesick i have been trying not to think about it because it makes me really sad i think i miss rosie and mom the most i miss ben but i am beginning to think that we are not right for each other the other night when we went to those frat parties i was thinking that i do not know if i can do it or not i am not sure whether i am missing him or missing the attention and also i know that we are not really in love and i do not see myself loving him i really miss what eric and i had and i think that is really the only relationship that i have been in where i was in love i think eric is mad at me because i called him the other day and he never called me back i wonder if things would have ended up differently if he had gone to school or even had a better career path than he does i really miss him but i do not think i could do the long distance thing with him any better plus , i know there were things wrong with him too i really wish i could combine the traits of both people i like and make a boyfriend specified to my desires i bet everyone does i ca not believe how tired i am i wish i could just go to

sometimes she smells really bad though , but i guess i do to when i do not take a bath for awhile i want to see regina 's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and i think she looks good with it kevin called today and wants mom and dad , well everyone to put their money they are contributing for grandma and grangpa 's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing the lady who did our hair is like 50 something but looks a lot younger like 35 or 40 no lie well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian i like black people , they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight , well when it comes to their family i guess they are but not just in general i like jz he 's cool but i do not know i think that i like all kinds of music , not any kind in particular sometimes i feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands , but i do not because i do not really like the music as much as i like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie , yeah ! other music like pop and rap it 's amazing how fast this time is going by like i thought it would take a lot longer or seem like i was typing a lot longer i like that song and i ca not believe a 14 year old sings it jojo what kind of a name is that ! i like the bangs i got cut , but i do not know if i am going to be able to fix it like this myself kyle is coming over later and i hope he likes my hair and if he does not well it 's not like i can do anything about it i wish i was better at volleyball and could have done more with it i mean i can jump high , but i ca not hit hard wow the gymnast was really short , but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall , i am glad i am tall , except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow i really have problems typing today i changed in the car , that was really not fun i should have planned it better oh well i guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them , just joking usa wow i'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices shampoo always smells good , well not always , but most of the time it would be so nice to be rich i need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies , lol breathing is a good thing laurie ca not reach the shampoo that 's no fun my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much

2004_193.txt 0 1 1 0 0 i'm feeling a little stressed right now i have two tests coming up in about a week and i'm kind of behind on my reading there is so much stuff to take care of now that i am out on my own it makes me miss my family i'm feeling kind of homesick right now when i woke up this morning i found myself crying i'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e mail told me how much he likes me it just happens to be my friend 's brother so i'm worried about what i should do i do not really have anyone to talk to about it and i just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me but , i did talk to my friend today and he helped me out , i'm glad i had someone to talk to i'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but i'm not sure because i think i need to stay and study but , i think i'm going to go anyway because i need a break and i need to feel more involved hopefully some people will go i wonder what i should wear i want to go shopping , i'm getting tired of always wearing the same things it kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room there are still boxes everywhere and i feel lazy for not getting rid of them , but i just do not feel like it i keep hearing door open in the hall , i wonder if my room mate is back it 's kind of awkward with her here i do not really know what to say and she is not very talkative i still ca not believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night oh well i'm watching this movie on tv about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing i mean i know i'm still taking classes , but its just not the same , it 's not as often it makes me feel out of shape , i hope that i do not gain a lot of weight because i'm not working out as much it felt so good to be back in class the other day i love the modern class , it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free i guess it 's more laid back because the dancers are not experienced and i'm one of the most experienced in the class that kind of makes me relax because i do not get as nervous as i do around all the good dancers in the other classes i get so nervous at auditions i do not know how in the world i'm going to get into those major 's dance classes then what am i going to do my ra just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie i feel kind of stupid going because i have already been and my friends are not going but , oh well , i guess that i will just go i feel like i need to meet more people the only people i have have hung out with while i have been here are rockport people i thought i was going to get away from all that , but i do not know i do not know what to write anymore i'm thinking to hard about this and i know i should not be i should just type whatever it is that i am thinking the time is almost up it went by surprisingly fast and i kind of enjoyed doing it it actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me it 's weird how writing can do that professor pennebaker did mention that in my class i guess it really is true i feel like i should have an ending to this but , i guess not i guess your thoughts never really end it kind of makes me nervous when i ca not think of what to write what does that mean it 's kind of like when i blank out talking to people which i seem to do a lot i'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out i wonder what the point of it is
2004_194.txt 0 1 1 1 0 i'm a little worried these past few days because of the work study award i know that i have a certain time limit to get a job and i'm trying to get a job but it 's so hard it 's even harder when you have never had a job experience before and my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job i know what i need to do , she just needs to lay off of me sometimes that 's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister , she will be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what 's going on in my life it 's not always bad because i do not do anything that will disappoint my parents the other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me , she can boss me around it 's not like i'm her slave or anything it 's just that i do not like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it i like being my own person , making my own decisions if only i had been able to do that since i was a kid so i would not have so much problems now ever since i could remember , my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor any doctor is ok as long as i made it well , what they want has followed me into my college life the only reason why i would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one so now i do not really know what i want to major in i had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want i'm just so obedient i do not know why but i'm just like ella in ella enchanted always obeying what others says so , my college life has been ok so far i like the campus a lot and i also like jester because it 's in the center of everything that i need the pcl is across the street , and the gym is adjacent to it also the food is right down on the 2nd floor of jester or downstairs at jcl very convenient the only bad thing about it so far is that i have a tv and that means trouble i have become addicted to the show three 's company i have to watch it everyday let 's see it comes on ch 40 at 10 11pm , ch 41 at 12 12 30am , ch 49 at 1 2am so i stay up late just to watch my three 's company i know it 's very silly especially since on monday 's , wednesday 's , and friday 's i have a 8am class but somehow i manage to get up and not feel tired at all amazing is not it but it probably will wear off soon another thing i have to mention , i am getting very tired of eating american food for every meal , i need something from my culture i need my rice ! so , i had a very wonderful labor day weekend because i went to houston to visit my new baby cousin , jason he 's 7 weeks old and o so adorable ! ! and jason 's almost 2 year old brother is also cute whenever we say anything to him all he says is 'i know' or 'i do not know' and laugh just so adorable and when i had to leave , he was all sad when i picked up my bag , he took it from me and put it back on the floor so i wo not leave i could talk forever about jason and jonathan but i did not really like the houston whether because it was raining the whole time so when we drove anywhere bugs would hit the window and front bumper so by the end of the trip , the front of the car was smothered with bug guts yuck ! hehe ) oh no ! my time is almost up ! well , i guess i can spend the remaining time saying my good byes goodbye , chao write to you laters got only a few more seconds it has been good writing down my feelings , getting it all out of my system i feel lighter ok , bye ! ! ! ! ! ! !

2004_199.txt 1 1 0 0 0 as i sat down to start typing , my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment a lot of times , i will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how i feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes i will even start talking about the songs i have heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings to be perfectly honest , i am thinking a lot about what my life once was like , all the good times , all the bad times , the lessons i have learned and through which ways i learned them i must say i am definitely a thinker , and someone who dwells on the past today has been a rather unusual day for me because i am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time i really miss my ex boyfriend , who was also at one time my best friend it 's like i am missing a huge piece in my life i keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time , thinking what if , and if only i had done this differently the only conclusion i come to is that there was nothing i could have done or said differently , i guess the feelings just were not there anymore and the basis of our at one time great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us yay , my favorite television show is on , well one of them anyways , 7th heaven ! from watching that show , i become relaxed and more open minded the lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts , very useful in life and this day in time i could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because i like it so much however , watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but i know if i eat , i will get sick to my stomach eating is a major thing to me , partly because i am very self conscious about my weight up until i got into high school , i never worried a whole lot about what i looked like or weighed , but freshman year hit me and i became paranoid i saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting caught doing what i had been doing of course my parents were disappointed , but they did not get mad at me , they were just worried i saw a psychiatrist , a counselor and a dietician the psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field , but my counselor , she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth in fact , it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist however , she does not know that i would really like to one day become a child psychologist i have always been interested in helping children hmm , i do believe the chicken nuggets i am fixing in the oven smell so good i cannot wait for this weekend to come i am going back home to see some friends and i think my friend adam and i are going to a football game friday night , and then saturday night , i get to race , which i am pretty excited about we did not get to race last weekend because it got rained out , which sucked , but i got to hang with my friend later that night , so it was okay wow , i just realized that i went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun i had from the previous weekend , and i just remembered about my hand there is something wrong with it and i'm not sure what it is , but it hurts i have a bump on it and every time i move my wrist downward , something pops over it to the left and when i bring my wrist back up , that thing pops back over to the right it is really gross and hurts , but luckily , friday , when i go back home i am going to the doctor to get it checked out it 's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you do not even realize it wow , its been over twenty minutes already and it does not seem like i have typed very much

2004_203.txt 0 0 1 1 0 this past weekend i took a short journey back to my home city of san antonio , texas i went there to get some more items from my house , and as you can tell i'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm the dorm itself i like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that i can feel as though i am actually going home each day after classes plus the food here is excellent this semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do however , last week was very satisfying due to the fact that i got much accomplished i got much of my studying done and i finally got my book situation in order at first when i went to the co op i bought all these different books for each of the classes i am taking and then i came to discover that i did not need about three of them so then i had to make time to go back and return the books that i no longer needed , and i had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me this weekend i also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not so good team , but i still managed to have a great time i bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me the day after the game when i went back to san antonio i got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old he is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make i was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth , but i will see him every now and then when i get a chance to journey back home i also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years we went out to eat and to see a movie we were not sure what movie to see so i thought i would let her pick because of the nice that i am , and she being the girl that she is picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street he immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her , but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her , but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted in the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be i ca not wait for winter time it is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and i go skiing in colorado occasionally some place different and go to most of the resorts there one of the worst times i have ever had there is when i wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us , and also this past year we went and i jumped a big snow jump , landed wrong , and i smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion all together i would have to say that i'm very excited about this year , and i ca not wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life
2004_211.txt 1 0 0 1 0 working out is stressful especially if all i do is arms man i am tired i wish i could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout i need to go to the bathroom but i ca not since i have to right this i'm glad that i finished the reading assignment over the weekend oh my arms are so heavy ! i like working out but sometimes it takes a toll my biceps are bulging and pulsing man i wish i could play a game right now and now i have gone blank a little its tough to do this to think about what one is thinking i need to move my mouse there we go now i need an arm pad or an extension to my desk man i wish i could rationally think sometimes or maybe i do i really need to extend this desk now i'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good wow , now i'm getting thirsty , but its probably because i just got done working out it says it is 76 degrees outside let me actually check it is a shake would taste good right about now jester 2nd floor was good today , but not like i had expected it a lot cheaper though its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than dine in dollars i have always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner i usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner so i wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner it probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner , or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then who knows and honestly who cares the room next door to us has a very squeaky door it slams hard ouch my deltoid i am hungry , or maybe thirsty i really ca not decide right now ouch ! wow 11 more minutes this has kind of gone by fast i thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment and i'm so glad i did my readings the weekend before it allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment those 30 seconds went by fast the people are always going in and out or maybe that 's just what it sounds like to me up till like even 2 am in the morning i can always hear people outside my window i wonder why they are up so late outside usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind well i'm going to get something to drink right now i have had the grape flavor yet so i'm going to see what that 's like never mind , my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how i was sore , or maybe just tired now i have a coke though but i need to fill my food void some applesauce would be nice but i do love sour punch straws mmmmm they are so good nah ill have applesauce there are also some grapes too green grapes ! my favorite i do not know why but i have never liked red ones or purple withe they call it my favorite color was purple because i loved the grape flavor so much now i have changed my ways because i have learned that purple is a feminine color now to get some applesauce i have to have 2 at a time or its not enough i'm a klutz i always drop things or trip at the worst times , but then most people do not trip when they want to i do not know why but i have been wanting to get fatter or at least gain wait for a long time now , but i need to eat healthy because i have high cholesterol i always wanted to gain weight because of football , now i just say it because i always have when buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible they are 4oz each it says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple , or just one apple yes ! 1 minute ! this applesauce is a little watery i hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it that really disgusts me when at first ketchup is not my favorite thing to eat but it goes good with french fries !
2004_215.txt 0 1 1 1 1 wow , so here i go this is actually pretty exciting , i do not think i have ever had such a fun writing assignment jessica 's music is on , her music was playing at the same time as mine , hers was rap , mine was honey and the moon , weird combination she 's still listening to it i have an aftertaste of godiva chocolate in my mouth , my sister sent me my shirt i forgot and i was just at drews , across the hall i wonder how i did on my bio exam we get the grades back today in our review session it was stressful but i think i did ok we will see i guess my sheets are bright i wonder what everyone is doing at home right now let 's see its almost 3 , so everyone 's working i miss jude , he 's so cute and now that i'm here i'm going to miss out on him taking his first steps , him first talking , etc but it was fun watching him grow i miss him the most it will be nice to be home next weekend , i want to lay out in the sun by my pool , with my dogs tonight 's going to be busy , with me catching up in all my classes and all but what i really want to do is see drew , because i like hanging out with him but then once i get back into my room , and i shut the door , that 's when reality sets in , and that 's when i realize that i have to stay with scott because he needs me right now and it would not be fair after all of this this writing assignment is pretty crazy , i still have awhile to go maybe i just do not have enough to write about let me think here i find myself staring into my panoramic photo of a sunrise on the beach in hawaii it 's a pretty tight picture , and i wish i could just be back there right now , instead of stressing here at school even though this experience is pretty awesome i still find myself stressing more than the ordinary college student my insecurities keep building up , until something or someone comes along and then i will let them fall down one of my goals is to be able to walk around with my head raised high up , chin up , smiling , confident i wish i could be that person , but for some reason i guess i feel too uneasy about my appearances most likely , that is the result of going to a school with really judgmental people oh well , it will just be something i need to grow out of here that 's one thing that i love about ut , no one really cares what you look like , talk like , etc it 's a nice change last night i had another crazy dream , i want to start writing them down but sometimes i just ca not remember them like last night , some guys broke into my house , and they were chasing us out but i somehow convinced them with my kindness or something ( as i do in many of my dreams that are very similar to this ) that they should leave us alone i just remember showing them my mastiff dog ok , is that even a dog , or did i make that up or what whoa , a crazy thing that came across my mind yesterday was this thought ( i was actually thinking about it yesterday in psychology class ) they say that color is the result of light being absorbed or reflected off of an object so in order to see color , there has to be light , right if that is true , then is it true whenever you go into a pitch black room , everything is actually without color ! i know that everything would not be in black and white , but would not everything be in black at least ! everyone would be of the same color in a dark room it 's pretty mind baffling to me also , i have heard that whenever you dream , you do not really dream in color , but your mind and memory make up the colors they are not true colors who really knows anyways the zipper of my dior makeup bag is dipping into the cap of my orange juice bottle that i had this morning last night was all fun and games until i got home and realized how unsure i am of everything right now , and it 's really not a good feeling i guess i'm just getting used to this whole thing , just transitioning jess forgot to get milk last night , so i had dry cereal this morning there is still some left in my bowl right here , i was too busy rushing around , trying to meet scott in time for chemistry
2004_216.txt 0 1 0 1 1 stream of consciousness that term reminds me so much of virginia woolf and my long semester studying her and mrs dalloway i ca not even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how mrs dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad i feel so bad for her i wonder how fast twenty minutes really is i bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but i guess it is kind of interesting i just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing i am so glad that it is labor day weekend and i am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and i guess some studying too although that wo not be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal it is so interesting how i am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and i some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that i can concentrate on just about anything i hope this year goes well because i think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year i if the semester goes well i'm getting kind of sad now that because i am leaving town tomorrow i am going to miss the first football which will be my first texas football game and i have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun , but at least there are plenty of other games that i can attend my hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering i have not even typed for 10 minutes i wonder if i am missing out on anything while i am sitting her typing this but i guess it is not that big of a deal i do not think there are many people her anyway and i do not know where anyone is i was thinking about how when i graduated from high school that i would be balling my eyes out but i did not cry then i thought i would cry when my parents left me here all alone but the weird thing is i have not cried or anything yet i have not even gotten homesick i mean let 's face it is not like i would have anything spectacular to do even if i was home so i guess that helps in the homesickness department it is so cold in my room i am absolutely freezing and there is no way in which to control the air , i need gloves and winter boots i really think that people need to something about the coolness of the buildings i mean i know it is hot outside and all but because it is hot outside students want to wear shorts and other things like that to keep cool when out in the heat , but then you step in a building and dorms are the absolute worst of all and you freeze to death like i am surprised i have not gotten frost bite from these frigid places well the time has actually gone faster than i expected it to it has not been all that bad once i got over the whole virginia woolf suicide and her book that i had to suffer through and analyze it has actually been kind of fun i mean all i have been doing is saying what is on my mind and how i am feeling and that is not so hard as long as you know that not everyone in the world is going to be reading what you write because personally i do not ' want everyone in the world to know how i feel all the time it is pretty personal for the most part i am really excited about getting to hang out at the lake this weekend and being able to relax and have food other than from the cafeteria not that the food is all that bad but a homecooked meal is the absolute best that is real comfort food wow i am beginning to feel hungry now but i do not know for what also i really need these twenty minutes to over so that i can run and go get a drink i am really thirsty oh my gosh my hands are like icicles between the pain from typing and the temperature of the room my hands are really beginning to suffer but hey i do not have to type for too much longer
2004_217.txt 1 0 1 1 1 being a twin i always wonder if my brother thinks like i do i do not mean like does he have the same thought i mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me my mind like to wander and i imagine many different scenarios in my head like where i will be in 20 years how long i will live and why people act the way they do everyday i think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest then you have people who succeed no matter what and i wonder why them then there are people who seem to go no where in life i am not seriously making this up for the past year or so i have been trying to figure out the world i guess since i have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home i also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career i felt at one time i was determined to be an astronaut , but now i am leaning towards the media business i would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad and good experience i am talking about me coming to college if this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how i think i continuously switching ideas in my mind it is a wonder of why i have some of the thoughts i have , but we wont go into that being my first to take psychology i wonder what the class is going to offer me , how it will help me to explore the human mind i have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed i stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends since being here i have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes , but i often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable this summer i worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how i should view the world there would be weeks when i got up at before 5 00 am everyday i kind of got this feeling like is this what i will be doing for the rest of my life i thought to myself therefore i will do good in college to help better the career working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars i wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and i guess they do somehow that is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when i believe there is an overall problem in certain area but are we certain at all what goes on
2004_218.txt 0 0 1 1 1 hey what 's up i just got home from school and hopefully i can finish doing this before my sister gets home and takes over the computer today was cool i got my hair cut finally and the girl that did it was really sweet i wish my hair was thicker though i'm trying to type as fast as i can in twenty minutes so i'm wondering how much i will really end up typing i ca not wait to go to college station this weekend i hope mom does not find out that i ran into that pole in the garage i think i'm just going to tell her that a car must have hit it i have the story all planned out and everything i would much rather drive karla 's car to college station this weekend i ca not wait to see austin again he 's so awesome i had so much fun at emo 's last night , minus the bear rocked sometimes i feel out of place at that place though because it seems like everyone is trying to hard to look like they do not want to go crazy when the band is playing i'm so happy they played my favorite song , too i was surprised how many victoria people were there too i think nick is so cute too ! i have not seen lynette in a while that was surprising i wonder if she still thinks i'm a bitch for all that crap in high school i'm starting to realize that austin is not as fun as i thought it would be it 's a crazy place to live , but after being in college station all i think about is how fun it would be to live there there 's so many teenagers and so much to do at night the cat 's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water i think i hurt it when he flew off the table i'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here i ca not remember the last time i ate at the same time karla did hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off which does not really matter anyways since there 's no place to park without having to pay five dollars i do not like going to eco class very much i feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and i have no idea what he 's talking about i have not even been reading as much as i thought i would in school maybe i should start too because it will probably start to get hard and then i really wo not know what anyone 's talking about i always wonder if austin is getting tired of me i know he always thinks about getting with another girl , but i would really like to see what he does and how he is when he 's all drunk at some party that 's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and roe fit in with them pretty good i think i know i should have joined that one group but i think i just wanted to know someone in it before i did i do not think i could ever afford to pay that much money anyways i ca not even hold on to a hundred in a week i need to stop buying so many clothes but there 's too many cute things i want i ca not wait to get regular cable , these channels suck i think me and austin will last a long time , we do not fight at all , so maybe being far away can be a good thing i bet a lot of people think i'm stupid for staying with him
2004_219.txt 1 1 1 0 1 i hate writing assignments , especially ones that have to be typed i'm such a slow typer maybe i should take some sort of remedial typing course i wonder if they have those at ut it 's weird how stressful this is i have such a short attention span , that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes , the fact that i'm quite possibly the world 's slowest typer really does not help much either i wonder if anyone will ever read this the copying machine behind me is irritating , i wonder how many copies the girl is going to make , it seems like she has been making copies forever even though i have only been here for ten minutes has it only been ten minutes damn , i have to be in here for at least another ten i'm so hungry , i wonder what i should eat when i'm done with this for me , one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food i do not have much money and i certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen whenever i get hungry i have to choose between fast food value menus and basically , just ramen i miss kinsolving food , there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student id i could eat as much as i wanted , and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed i should make more friends who live on campus so i can get them to buy me food with their meal plans , or at least go home and eat some of my mom 's food wow , my twenty minutes are up

2004_222.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i feel cold , my toes are really brittle feeling , i want to get in my bed right now , it is so warm in there , i feel closest to home went i am under my covers trying to sleep , the best feeling ever in the world is being really cold and then jumping into a warm bed that is what i want right now , if my new dorm was not so cold i would not be rambling about this topic but wow is it cold although i do enjoy is freezing at night during the day i would not mind a little heat i mean come on now at camp all summer it is so warm i just want to burst every time i walked outside i got that amazing warm sensation over my whole body i remember it so clearly that thawing feeling well i who will get my hopes up here i am now in college in the cold away from friends and family and camp but i should not feel so isolated sitting in this cold and unhomely room well i should this place is absolutely depressing ha ha that is so funny how in class we talk about depression and more sleep is associated with it and i totally know that i will be napping after this assignment but no really college is the time of your life or so i am told but so far my two weeks at ut have not been the greatest of my life but then again i have herd stories about people coming here and not liking it for awhile and then they magically start to have fun this is not a cry for help by the way you know the one you warned us about not writing because it would not be read well that is not what this is i am just thing about me and how different i am it is strange the qualities i posses i always think that i am unique and different but there are a million people out there one has to be like me but the more i think about myself the more i am convinced that there is absolutely no one else like me on one side i feel lonely but realistically i love my friends because of the differences between us i feel like all i have is me with your best friends you can tell them anything in the world about how you are feeling and you can trust them and now all those people are gone and when i talk to them on the phone it is just not the same and we seem to be growing a greater distance apart wow i just realized what a sob story this is this is not a cry for help at all what roommate just walked in and totally broke the sob story train i mean he is a nice guy and all and we will get alone fine and everything for a whole year but i definitely do not think that we will be best friends or anything and i really am not going to make a conscience effort to befriend anybody i am quite satisfied all by my self in this way i am really different i mean yes all people need to belong to the group and have friends and fit in but i think that i just have i stronger resistance to such social things as that besides a lot of people have told me that they were never friends with their roommates but that they did have a lot of fun with them so maybe i should be more open to the idea of hanging out with the guy even though he reminds me of a phony awe holden cawfield i ca not say phony without thinking about holden cawfield from catcher in the rye i really should not have read that book at the age i did it turned me on in weird ways and i do not think i understood
2004_229.txt 0 0 1 0 0 well , this assignment is interesting i do not think i have ever attempted to write for 20 minutes straight i wonder if i have adhd or add or if its just because i am a drummer wow ! i have only gone for a minute and i am already bored um i was watching the cowboy game and they won 20 17 vinyl did well but threw an interception i think he will be good this year as lond as he does not get hurt he has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses speaking of defenses ( i doubt this has any relation ) but anyways i did not make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing i really wanted to make it and thought that i had a decent chance maybe i gave myself too much credit maybe i am not big enough or something i wish i could have made it but i suppose that one was up to the coach and god speaking of god ( random again ) i went to a really neat church last sunday its name is glad tidings it is an assembly of god church ( although i am lutheran i think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons ) i miss my old church though my youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend i am unsure if i should go home this weekend i do not know i think i will stay here because i really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend i am really tired tonight but i suppose i will do my best to continue typing the entire 20 minutes but along the thought of the laundry business i have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend ( was going to do this weekend but i think i can make it until then ) it has been really hot lately it was brutal last saturday trying to run in the morning it was so humid it eventually rained but not until after the practice i have never been so sore in my life i am still sore but i guess it does not matter seeing as i am not going to be playing for the team i suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe i will try and keep in shape i do not know though we will see well i am half way there i am still tired and i am finding this assignment very boring and i suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring kind of sad i suppose i wish i were not so lonely tonight just me and the tv a horrible invention it is ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals but i suppose it helps many escape i like to escape by playing video games i think i might play one in a few minutes when i get done with this thing but yaw i really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on it but it is really fun and entertaining i am still tired still tired but only about 7 minutes to go ! hurray ! this makes me excited i did not have an antecedent before the this nor did i there but that was because i quoted the previous mistake i wonder who just walked by my room it sounded like two girls i wonder if there really is a girl out there for me probably i hope so one can only hope ca not one it 's funny , i accidentally made a typo and said ca not none which if one thought about it logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about it from a texas perspective it would have the opposite negative and depressing effect i hope for the logical i heard a papa john 's commercial i wonder how they can claim they have better ingredients , or better pizza it is subjective i would think there is another weather report on tv i find it interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them ( i usually just go with the flow ) the flow of the easy river i guess it is 11 o'clock only a minute left here 's my chance to say something deep i really ca not think of anything but live the golden rule and you will find yourself a better person love is all you need as paul said ( the beatle of course lol ) that 's it !

2004_233.txt 1 0 1 1 1 well i guess i can start with my dream last night since that is what i've been thinking about all day it was so crazy i had a dream that i was sitting on the couch in my room and talking with a friend when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door i open the door and it is a dark figure , like a person , but the lighting in my apartment was that of the time of day that dusk sets in well she walks i and covers my mouth and lays me down on the floor and holds me with all force while she is chanting some mysterious chant in my ear i do not know what she was saying but at that point i wake up in my dream as i'm struggling to move my body i could not move until i realized i was out of my dream , which was maybe 3 seconds later how creepy is that when i woke up the chant was repeating in my head for like 10 seconds and then i completely forgot it i do not know what that was about but it seems to me that it has to do with someone putting a spell on me i have felt ghosts before but i never felt a bad sense coming from them weird i always wonder what dreams are really supposed to mean i mean people can buy dream books all they want but what are the chances of those interpretations being the same for all of us i am a little worried about that but i have not really been a bad person in the past with anyone that i can think of oh well anyways i have to really buckle down today and do some serious studying if i want to enjoy the weekend like i should hopefully i will be studying on the beach saturday night not that the south padre beach ids that beautiful after going to cancun for a week though i guess its hard to actually top that beach that was the best time i believe in my life so far it is good to know that i will be going on many more trips like that considering how easy it was to plan that trip saving the money was super hard but i feel like if i really want to do something i am capable of making that happen i hope this weekend is as good as last weekend i am going back to san antonio to see my family since it has been two weeks since my last visit i really love the night life over here though maybe because everything is so new over here and i really love change period i am not scared to completely change my patterns in friendships and relationships for that matter i came over here knowing 3 people in the whole city now i know just a few more but the possibility of me meeting so many more is very high on the scale i really miss my best friend a lot though her and i hung out all summer together , and all last year in school for that matter she was all i needed and i was the same for her now we are spirited and she 's getting back with her boyfriend and will probably end up married with children its a sad world when you see people you love so dependant on the wrong things at the wrong time her relationship with that boy is so lame thank god i have no time for stuff like that right now i cannot relate to her attachment to him and would love to keep it that way for a really long time hopefully she will snap out of it though and realize that her whole life is ahead of her man this is a really long time to be typing straight on the computer everyone around me is getting annoyed by how much i am typing they keep staring at me , then the screen and back to me hahahahahahaha ! lets see well i have been trying to explore the campus and look for spots to study that no one can find but unfortunately there are too many damn students in this place to accomplish that goal this life sciences library is really nice i think its the high ceilings that make me feel so comfortable in here there are always open computers in here as well well my time is almost up my experience in the psy class is very important to me considering i want to be a psychiatrist one day
2004_235.txt 0 1 1 1 0 i am in the library right now writing this stream of consciousness i just had dinner it was very delicious i ate at the kinsolving dormitory food center the library is really quiet and i can hear the tying on the computer people are walking in and out and it is a little bit distracting i ca not wait until this week is over it will be labor day weekend i ca not believe a holiday is just around the corner it seems like just yesterday it was summer and i was having fun playing with my friends and hanging out over the labor day weekend , i would love to go back home to houston and see my family , but i kind of would prefer to just stay here in austin there is so much to do here and there is so much freedom in a way it can be good but i really need to manage my time wisely today 's psychology was really interesting i loved the in class experiment that was done it was pretty cool how the experiment worked especially since the first time was easy to tell when the girl was lying and the second time was really hard i feel tired right now and i would like to go to sleep , but i know i should get this writing assignment out of the way i was talking to my brother about computers today it was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone my mind went blank for a while and i ca not think of anything to write tomorrow is one of my best friend 's birthday i ca not believe she will be one year older she is a senior in high school right now and i bet she is stressing over college applications like i was during senior year i hope she gets everything done in time i remember senior year was really interesting i had to research a lot with colleges and what i wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major so far , education is what i want to do i think it will be fun especially if i decide to work with elementary students i am feeling really sleepy right now and i can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before i miss my family even though i am used to being away for a month i know i will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months i hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives i also miss my friends back home especially my church family i ca not believe i am actually going to say this or actually type it but i also miss my pastor especially his sermons as i am here in austin , i have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor 's sermons here are just not the same i guess i am really used to how he tried to make it apply to our daily lives and tried to really relate to us especially since i grew up in that church , i really miss all the good memories i have made there i ca not wait until the weather gets colder here in austin i heard last year it snowed for a day in the morning i really would like to see falling snow i really love the cold weather and i like to play in the snow today 's weather was nice i could feel the cool breeze blowing in my face there was less sun than usual maybe it is supposed to rain who knows but i can definitely feel a weather change coming soon hopefully i still ca not believe that i am a freshman in college i thought when i arrived here i would finally believe it but it is really hard to sink in so far classes have been fun and a little boring at the same time i try to think positively and try to learn something out of each time i spend in class i am really worried about the tests and quizzes here at the university i just do not know what to expect especially since different teachers do different things i really hope that i will do well in the first semester of college in fact i hope to do well all the years i am in college i think i have kind of forgotten how to study after college applications were done and over with and after i knew where i was going to attend college , i kind of stopped studying really really hard for classes i still studied but just not as hard and not as much as i should have i feel like taking a shower and going to bed now my eyes feel they are slowing shutting but i'm trying to keep awake there are so many people here at the library i knew there would be a lot of people but it 's amazing to see how a lot of people use their time wisely and study and also take the time to do their homework even when there are so many temptations to go out and party i suddenly feel itchy everywhere i think a bug bit me it is really annoying and itchy this has been the most exciting assignment ever it will be really weird to look back on what i wrote
2004_236.txt 0 1 1 0 0 i just clicked the go button for this writing assignment for psychology and i just almost misspelled psychology it is amazing how i ca not spell psychology and how i still stumble on spelling it on the keyboard , psychology , i just did it again at the beginning and before this page there was a precautionary note that said if people were insecure about their confidentiality it is just an assignment , what could possibly go wrong the teacher or ta will steal your identity ! if they do they some students should sue that is weird i ca not believe i just wrote that i am writing this assignment now because i have some spare time and the writing assignment is due on friday i do not even know when i would have done this assignment i have free time because my computer science class was , i guess canceled i hope it was canceled because i hate missing class it feels as if i am missing some knowledge that is necessary for my brain i hate when i am unsure if class is actually canceled added to that , i hate when people are still in class sitting in the room waiting for class to start those students make me uncomfortable because it seems as if they know ( they do not ) that we actually have class i am in the computer lab typing this writing assignment and i do not know what else to write about let 's think i am thinking okay , i am in the corner , near corner of the computer lab and i am typing oh yeah , speaking of writing assignments , my architecture writing assignment is going to be difficult because my ta wants us or prefers that we use chicago style in our papers when he asked us if anyone did not know how to use chicago everyone was quiet and a huge pregnant pause was present it is weird that teachers still do not understand that if students are quiet when they ask a question , nobody knows the answer it is weird i am now thinking if i am even doing this assignment correctly it seems as if i am tracking my thoughts of this past week i hope i still get credit for this class i do not even know this class is hard or easy yet maybe i should reply that girl who mass emailed everyone and say that we should start a study group a study group would hopefully help me learn more about this subject i hope i can pass this class because as much as it is interesting i do not think i can sit through more of the same demos or demonstrations the experimental requirement is pretty cool i am almost done and i am happy about that i do not have to write a 5 page research paper yeah ! writing research papers can be a hassle calculus is progressing fast and i am sort of surprised that i am grasping the notes real well i am understanding calculus , weird even though it is my major i still think that i should be able to be better than what i have been doing for that class thirteen minutes and whatever seconds , is how long i have been typing so far this is sort of getting tiring i wonder how psychologists interpret this writings i ca not wait to read what the explanation for this writing assignment is i think it would be cool if one of our tests was just writing this kind of stuff write what is on you mind for 20 minutes that would be weird it would be a completion test grade , which would be cool i think i have 4 more minutes , and it is weird that i said 'think' because i can not subtract and i am a math major well my calculus professor said that he has problems with simple arithmetic also so i am not that worried it always reassures me that teachers professors have the ability to forgot simple things like that it makes myself better i ca not wait for this timer to be over i am waiting and i am just typing stuff down i have 2 minutes left so when i am done with this minute i will have 60 seconds left so , yeah time is dwindling down i wonder how many people are doing this assignment right as i am doing this assignment what will i do after this oh yeah i have to read for my next class wait ! i have to read for this class i ca not believe i for got , i need to read for this class after my music class
2004_237.txt 1 0 1 1 0 i have just returned to my room from my biology class madeline forgot her notes so she has borrowed mine so i cannot study them at the moment i am very excited because i got a full meal for only 3 00 ! i got a free coke , a free corner of a sandwich , 2 free candy bars and i bought a berry and yogurt parfait for 3 bucks , which by the way was really tasty it is in my refrigerator now because i have only eaten breakfast about two hours ago well tomorrow at 3 30 i will be done with classes for the week and i am thinking of driving home for the night to lake jackson it is a three hour drive , but i am not really homesick , just feel kind of lost the reason i will tell anyone else for going home is to pick up my new computer see the one i have works fine plugged into the wall but for some reason unknown to myself and three dell representatives technical experts the battery will not charge so they have sent me a entire system replacement , after first trying to merely replace the battery which is what should happen because when one orders a 2000 system they would hope it would work so my next class is in about an hour and a half it is biology which is interesting to me for the most part it is my major , but i have been planning on changing it i chose it mostly because what i was interested in was medicine and i wanted to go to medical school after college now , i am not quite sure that is what is for me , although it was never a sure thing now i was thinking of changing to some sort of liberal arts degree where i could take more classes of interest to me and also spanish which i recently tested out of 13 hours ! ! i could also go from there to med school or law school or whatever sort of graduate school i decide on there are so many decisions to be made now that i have finally chosen a college i still am wondering about that decision i mean i have always loved texas , my dad went here and the school just has everything to offer maybe that is the problem too much i just sort of feel like i'm not fitting in , but then again is not that what ut is about , being an individual well , i definitely like to be an individual and my own self , but i would like some friends , a group who will call and see what i'm doing , call to hang out i mean i have been here only 11 days and i'm worried well not yet , i am still giving it time but i just feel so down on myself and anti social the only people i have really hung around are from my hometown not that it 's all bad , i just was so ready to branch out into something new ! so going home just seems like a good answer at the time , i even thought maybe i chose the wrong college , but how can i say that when i have been here not even two weeks at home , making friends was always easy i was the center of focus there had everything , here there is so many that i am , well , unnoticed that in itself is a change but then i think is not everyone else going through the same thing then if everyone else is , then why do not we just get together well i guess the world does not work that way but i have not given up yet , there is still hope the first football game is saturday and i know that will reinforce my love for the school i loved going to the games when i was not a student at this school maybe i can meet some friends then so it is labor day weekend coming up mostly i need to be studying , but that is what school is about i think we may float the river , so that will be fun i have started swimming this week and really want to go tonight , but i have a study session for bio at 7pm , , hopefully there will be enough time to get there swim , change and make it over to welch i just am not sure how to work it all out drive , walk , ride the bus i do not live in a city and things are so different here the town i am from , i did not even live in the city limits hhmmmm but i really need to workout i am not going to get fat in college i need to lose pounds right now , not gain them but food is everywhere , i guess you can see by the free food well maybe i can just eat some now and some between next class to prevent excess snacking but the candy bars are not good ok , before next class i need to read some bio and some psychology , but what i really want to do is lay in my bed , listen to music , watch tv maybe take a nap nope not here in the college world wow , i like to write down my thoughts it is soul clearing
2004_239.txt 1 0 0 1 1 this writing assignment seems a little silly i mean i'm probably going to spend the first 10 minutes of this thinking about the actual assignment and that does not seem very interesting actually i'm already thinking about something else i ca not wait for austin city limits we keep forgetting to buy tickets , i need to write that down i highly doubt it will sell out but i want to hurry up and buy them jack johnson is so good i ca not wait to see him we definitely need more decorations in our room fifty percent of our walls are still blank and its sort of depressing maybe that poster sale is still going on maybe i will have my mom send some of my posters from home i need to remember to call my mom later i wonder if she misses me a lot oh god , it 's only been 3 minutes this is getting a bit boring i really hope surprising brian was a good idea i just hope doug does not give it away hell , i hope i do not give it away ! i wonder if i'm doing this assignment right oh well pennebaker said himself that no one was probably going to read it i need to do some calculus after this i'm so pumped i actually understood it today hopefully it will stay like this i'm so worried about the tests in that class ill be so pissed if that class brings down my grade damnit i keep hitting something that makes the cursor jump lines its so annoying i just love jack 's voice , its so soothing its hard to write as you think my thoughts are moving faster than my fingers i hope the other surveys i do online are not as stupid as the one i just did i'm happy i guess , though , that it was so hard to name things i was dissatisfied with in my life i could not even think of ten i made up half of them well not exactly made up but they were not things i was actually stressing over was that even close to being grammatically correct 7 minutes 30 seconds ahhh i hope this weekend is fun i'm looking at the football stadium out my window i'm excited for my first ut football game ever it better be good i hope our seats are good i wonder what kelly 's sister will be like hopefully fun and easy to talk to i hope i meet a lot of people at the meeting i'm going to tonight hopefully guys to be exact although i bet its going to be a lot of chicks since its the university democrats i hope not everyone is a hippie chip on their shoulder socialist type i mean i hope they are intelligent and not just the being different for the sake of being different type 10 minutes half way there yay ! i'm really worried about laura i hope she finds her dream job soon i hate seeing her depressed because i know she is but she does not talk about it i hope her and dell are working out he can be so oblivious sometimes are not most guys my first instinct is to treat this like an essay and explain who i am talking about but i do not think this is supposed to be like an essay what the hell would a shrink get from reading this crap it ca not be very interesting to anyone else i need to go dvd shopping , our dvd collection is seriously lacking i hope raising our beds is not that hard we definitely need a change in our room i think i want another bowl of lucky charms but i suppose i should finish this thing first 4 99 for a box of lucky charms ! what a rip i guess i should have know cypress would be like that i should ask kelly if she wants to go to the grocery store tomorrow it sucks not having a car down here i miss my jeep its going to feel weird to drive when i get home i ca not freaking wait ! ! 6 more minutes i guess its going pretty fast this thing just seems like a waste of time but i guess it must have some purpose if we have to do it i actually need to finish reading for this class ca not forget to do that wow looking at what i have wrote my thoughts seem pretty disorganized hmm what does that say about me i think being a therapist would suck i would not be able to listen to depressed people whine all day long wow that sounded terrible but i suppose its true maybe i'm just not patient enough 4 minutes i need to figure out how my scanner works i need to take pictures so i can send them to my family my fingers are starting to get tired i have typed a lot i still have not found light bulbs for my stupid ikea lamp maybe we can go to target tonight i think my punctuation and spelling as gotten worse as i went along oh well i think he said that we do not need any of that 2 minutes thinking about my thoughts is hard , i'm like freezing up i wonder what would happen if i hit the finish button now i'm not going to try it because after all of this i want my credit for this assignment ! i wish i was disciplined ( spelling ) enough to keep a journal it would be fun to go back and read stuff like 5 years later i always start it and never pick it up again i wonder what that says about me i'm busy ohhhh 50 seconds ! i wonder what the fba meeting will be like hopefully nice people will be there i wonder how much of a commitment it is hopefully
2004_241.txt 0 0 1 0 0 ok , i guess i should be typing , that clock is making me kind of nervous well , whatever , i just saw my roommate , i really did not know she was going to be here i feel really nervous , i do not know why oh yeah , i really need to work on my first paper for my english class i hope i get a good grade , because when i work on it , i feel as if it should be harder that what it actually is gosh , my math class really sucked today i did not understand a word she was saying , but that 's ok , because so did the rest of the class i wonder what my mom is doing , oh and my dogs too i really miss them even though my dog hates me and is kind of crazy , i miss him so much 6 minutes , that 's it ! it feels as if i have been typing forever before i forget i need to talk to daisy today , man that girl is so crazy i also got to talk to lillian , just to see how her day went napoleon was being so funny last night , i really like talking to him at night , even though we talked until like midnight i wonder what kind of music that guy is going to play in my psychology class he usually plays weird music , today it 's going to have to do with the brain , that will be interesting , i suppose i hope i'm doing this right who ever reads this , if it 's ever actually read , will probably think it was lame oh , well you are also going to find plenty of mistakes , opps my bad gosh , that sounded like a line out of that movie clueless i feel clueless a lot , so that 's ok i ca not wait to go to sleep , that 's one of my favorite things to do ever since school started this past 3 day weekend was great because i got to wake up so late and just hang around my dorm with my roommate she 's cool i'm so glad i get along with my roommate , because i have been hearing some roommate horror stories lately , i guess i lucked out wow , i have been writing for 16 minutes ! i guess it was harder to get started i wonder if the people around me think i'm writing like this really long email to someone they are probably thinking i'm a loser , ha ha that 's kind of funny to think about daisy is probably talking to her internet boyfriend right now at a computer on campus her boyfriend is so funny some girl just sat next to me , i hope she does not read this i do not know what else to say , my time is almost out ahhhh ! i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this well my time is up , it was great , but i have got to print out my biology lecture
2004_243.txt 0 1 0 1 1 well , i have to confess , this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do i am an extremely objective person and it 's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight , but maybe this will get easier as i go i hear tv in the next room my mom is in the kitchen and watching the republican national convention i really should be watching it you because you see i'm a government major ( at least that 's the plan right now ) however , and ironically , the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention there now talking about kerry not being a good leader but the ac which is located next to my room has just come on and now i ca not hear wow , this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what i'm thinking it 's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain is thinking ah , pancakes are ready i would like to go eat them now but i'm stuck here for another 9 minutes and 43 seconds ooppss , she used baking soda instead of baking powder no pancakes i guess i went to the phantom of the opera last semester it was a broadway production and vg i have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk , which is why i bring it up i was depressing though , for all the talent and wonderful set changes do you like the sound of the ac i do i do not know why but it comforts me i think the reason it does is because when i was younger the ac would come and there was a vent right over my bed so to keep warm i would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and i like to snuggle that was a run on sentence but that 's how i think , in run ons , so i'm just trying to be accurate i had to look up how to spell sentence yes , i know that 's horrible , but you see i'm a very phonetically spell , always have been , and so it 's very hard for me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels like in the word sentence , i'm always unsure if it 's sentence or sentence another example is that i used to spell they they because the e sounded like a long a to me i better fix that if i'm going into government
2004_244.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i am overwhelmed with lots of work yesterday was very productive , and i intend for today to be the same way i have no history to work on but i have to work on some latin and some astronomy and go to a help session i need to call andrew and see if he wants to go see thomas in college station this sunday i hope he wants to do that because i want to be here on saturday so that i can watch the football game in austin and spend time with matthew and study saturday i need to eat some lunch soon but i have some things i need to get done before that the lawn mower outside is very annoying , and i hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns last year they would start the mowers at 7 when i was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me there is a party on 6th tonight that i might go to but i am not sure of that , because i do not really like the group of people that are going i do not want matthew to go to that party in north austin because he will end up staying there , and that makes me uncomfortable this guy is going to acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party that sounds a little bit like high school to me the people i have met from acc just do not seem to have work ethic and i just do not understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far i have noticed that there are many people at this school that do not think twice when they speak up , thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak there is too much individualism , people only want to listen to themselves talk we live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves i find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature they pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words i love bob dylan , people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says oh , their just words its great , i love it i need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night , i saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss emma at home i love that dog , she is so cute , i swear she has human tendencies i just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you i love dogs so much , i ca not wait to be able to have my own aww , my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately , and i ca not stand it , it is just this sound that keeps on going , never gets worse or better , it just lulls , and drives me crazy i hate this place so much sometimes there is too much estrogen in this building , and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me why ca not my brother come up here during the week , i just do not get it it is so old fashioned i understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying , but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester i had a full day of academics i started around 8 and did not finish till around 12 , and i went to sleep so exhausted that i had no trouble falling asleep but , i wake up in the morning with my back so sore i do not know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body , i do not know i just know it is not ' from working out , cause i have not done that in a while i am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment , i have not gained any weight in a long time , and i do not want to let myself last year i gained like 5 pounds and i hated myself for it , but luckily i lost it i need to take more pics and get that battery charged , it is annoying that my dad has that charger i wont go home until texas v ou so i wo not get it until then , damn i really want the fall to come , where the days are always in the 60 's and 70 's it is such beautiful weather , and no humidity so my hair does not go crazy on me arg , i just need to pace myself today , i do not want to be doing work late tonight , i want to finish around 8 or something , that would be nice
2004_245.txt 1 0 0 0 0 this is raechal collins my feelings are good right now i think i am going home this weekend for the first time since i have been up here i do not know if it is for sure yet , but i'm excited to see everyone that i have not seen in a while my roommate is in a bad mood because she found out her ex boyfriend is dating a junior in high school which is just gross also , one of my best friends from high school is not very happy i do not know why but she just does not seem happy my absolute best friend in the world is coming down this weekend though so i might be staying in austin for that i just want to go home to see my boyfriend , or whatever it could be considered i'm waiting for him to write me back right now even though i ca not really write him back because i'm writing on this thing for twenty minutes i'm excited about this class i think it 's going to be a lot of fun it 's by far my most interesting one , next to swimming i'm excited for that one cause it will be a good form of exercise and i need a way to get some exercise up here since all i seem to be doing is eating i wonder how everything is back home it 's really hard to do the long distance thing , but its weird how they say time apart can make the heart grow fonder , when all it has done to me is make me grow more detached in a way , i guess it is good , but at the same time , it 's kind of sad , because if i was home right now , everything would be the same , and we would be together except now i'm here and i need to branch out and meet new people i'm also doing this sorority business and i really do not know if it 's meant for me i like it , but i mean it seems like its just girls who join a group to get sisters for life and i do not know if it is something i want to spend all my time and parent 's money doing i never realized how much things coasted until i came here it is absolutely insane now i have to actually keep track of my money and its so hard i had no idea how much i spent a month i hate my anthropology class it 's hard and i do not understand what 's going on in there also my teacher is blind which is really cool and respectable but its almost distracting because i find myself staring at his guide dog or wondering what he 's feeling since he is standing in front of a class of 100 plus and he ca not see them for all he knows we could be throwing stuff leaving class eating drinking and being absent my friend is being shady and trying to rub in getting her third choice sorority when my other friend got first it is weird we have to figure out where i am living next year it is kind of stressful because every body knows where they are living and i do not have a clue cause i have not thought about it once tomorrow night i am going to the ato pledge line it should be fun a lot of my guy friends went ato so i like hanging out with them i like my roommate jen she is a badass and we all have fun i also like kelley , my other roommate actually they are both my suite mates my roommate is kim from high school it made it easier moving in and stuff with a roommate i already knew i would have hated moving in a finding that my roommate was someone who did not speak english or like hated life or something like that this twenty minutes is lasting longer than i thought i did not expect to write this much romeo and juliet is playing in my room right now , and i love this movie i have not seen it in forever either i remember when it first game out i was obsessed with leonardo deception now in real life , he is not at hot as he used to be he just killed himself in the movie the ending of the movie play is very depressing , and my arms and wrists are starting to hurt with all this typing i need to pick out an outfit to wear to the ato thing tomorrow night i guess i'm supposed to wear a cocktail dress i do not want to get all dressed up i have done enough dressing up for the past week during rush welp , the twenty minutes is over , it was nice talking to you computer
2004_246.txt 1 1 1 0 1 this is getting really old this is my second time doing this because the page keeps shutting down or going back and i have no idea what 's happening to my other writings so now i'm getting really annoyed because i have other homework to be doing i also have to do the prescreening because i tried doing it last night and the computer kept crashing i'm watching the sandlot i remember this movie from when i was a little kid me and my brothers would always watch it they always tried to make me watch michael myers and i'm so scared of him they used to dress up like him and have his mask and hide in my room at night they were pretty mean to me now that i'm gone i miss them so much mayra and john keep arguing and whispering stuff to each other and i wish they would stop they make it so obvious that they do not want me to hear i hope i do not have to start over again because that 's going to make me so mad i'm going to the incubus concert next week and i'm so excited the only thing that sucks though is that i have a test on monday in this class and also my precal class which means i have to hurry up and study and not slack off i do not want to be one of those students who mess up at the very beginning of their college years and then wish they would not have this timer is going really slow and i'm getting really sleepy i did not go to bed until six in the morning i was up watching videos and eating cereal today is nichol 's birthday and instead of me buying her something she bought me a glow in the dark wish bear i thought that was very sweet of her but i feel bad because i have no idea what to get her for her birthday she has everything that she could possibly want were going to go eat at red lobster on saturday and were going to the movies to watch wicker park i already saw that movie this weekend but i liked it so i want to see it again it was about a girl who becomes obsessed with this guy i wonder why people become obsessed with others i mean does it have to do something with their brain or is it just lust and they want to get their way i hope i do good in college i do not want to mess up i'm not even sure what i want my major to be i was premed at the beginning and i still am but it seems really difficult and it needs a lot of determination and hard work i know i could do that if i really wanted to but i want to have a life outside of school and it seems that 's all that doctors have time for , books and work so i'm getting really hungry and my head is starting to hurt john and mayra are still arguing and i do not like it at all i feel bad when people argue because i feel i should try to make everything better i know its usually none of my business but i like to make people happy all of my friends tell me that 's a bad quality because i never end up doing what i want but the thing is i do not want to hurt anyone especially those i care about i feel like i'm hiding so many things from so many people but they would never understand me and plus i do not want to disappoint them i know that if they really loved me they would understand and be happy for them but i'm not sure i want to take that chance especially if i do not even know what 's going to come out of it i'm probably not making any sense right now and i wish this would hurry up because they are really getting mad now and i'm using johns computer so i feel like i'm using him and mayra is getting mad at him and he is doing me a favor by letting me use it they left the tv on a baseball game and i do not want to watch that i need to go and check in with my job because i need to start working already i'm running out of money and i do not want to ask my mom for money because she has bigger things to worry about i just want to make it on my own and make her proud they are all doing so much for me to be here that i do not want to make them doubt why they believe in me so much i really want to go home and watch tv and fall asleep and forget about everything that 's going on right now i feel like pretty soon everything is going to crash and burn and its going to be all my fault and i'm going to be left with nothing except regret i regret not being honest with everyone right now but i'm just trying to take things one day at a time hopefully everything will get easier and make more sense because i have no idea what i'm going to do if it does not i hope that everything that is happening is happening for a reason
2004_248.txt 0 1 0 0 1 well , i today i'm feeling pretty lovely i woke up this morning and went to the gym afterwards i took a shower and went downstairs to get something to eat i met up with this boy i am talking to , he 's really sweet and sexy he makes me feel special but i'm being very cautious in this little relationship , because i tend to wear my heart on my sleeve , and i do not feel like getting hurt anyways , my sandwich was really good i'm also watching seinfeld right now actually if you want to be technical with it , i'm not watching it because i'm typing right now , but it 's on in the background but yah , i love seinfeld i think it 's the greatest show in the world i am still amazed at how someone can write a nine season show about nothing that 's crazy you know what else i think is crazy i do not know how in world i'm going to manage my time between classes and work study and the gym and my social life it 's like there is so much to do especially with all this reading i have to do for psy now that 's crazy ! why do we have to read so much why ca not the teacher just teach it to us maybe i'm just being lazy who knows yes ! another episode of seinfeld is coming on anyways , on monday there 's a seinfeld marathon it starts at 7am until the end of labor day that is really cool i ca not wait but yah i wonder what grade i'm going to get in this class i have done all my experiments i be damned if i had to write some 5 page psychological paper so you know i got started on those experiments asap okay ! anyways , i really do not know what else to write about so lets see let me think what else can i talk about oh yeah ! there 's a football game tonight i hope we win i wish i could go , but i did not but any tickets i do not even know where to buy tickets from i should of just got a sports package that would of made my life a whole lot easier i have this football player in my class actually he 's in two of my classes he 's nice we study together , because our rhetoric class is kind of difficult , and he 's always falling asleep in class i do not blame him they work those football players really hard a little bit too hard that 's just ridiculous sometimes i feel for them , because like how do they expect them to do good in school , when there only getting like 5hrs of sleep a day that 's not good , especially with all that strenuous activity they do i know i would not be able to do it i know after i come back from the gym , i'm ready to go back to sleep so i really feel for the football players but i guess if you really want to make it to the nfl , you got do it you got to stick with it and that really goes for anything if you want to accomplish any of your goals , then you have to stick with the game plan anyway , you know it really has not hit me that i am in college yet i mean it kind of hit me last week , when i was going out with some of my friends and it was like , i do not have to call my mom and tell her what i'm doing , i do not have to worry about her sending out a search party for me i do not have to answer to nobody it 's so great i love this ! anyway , the way i see it if i just find out some way to manage my time with work , gym , classes , and my social life then everything should just work out fine yah in a perfect world anyways , looks like i got about 4 more minutes to right okay lets , see you know what my favorite episode of seinfeld is the very first episode , when jerry and george where doing laundry that 's a really good episode i know like every word , scene , move everything about that episode anyways , looks like i'm going on only two minutes left two minutes and forty seconds two minutes and 30 seconds two minutes and 20 seconds two minutes and 10 seconds two minutes and now we have one minute left all right i'm on a roll here lets see , i guess i will just sign off now well this has been really fun i hope whoever is reading this has enjoyed reading this have a great day and a great like 5 seconds left and good bye !
2004_249.txt 1 0 0 0 0 it 's a bit past 4 pm on a sunday , and i only just woke up a while ago so here i am , writing a psychology paper which has no definite topic as such i usually listen to laid back electronic type music when i do papers , which is what i'm doing now i feel it helps me free up my mind , and help me think more clearly i do not know how this paper is going to end up , or whether i'm writing what i'm supposed to , but i suppose that 's the point of the exercise so tracking my thoughts well first off i just realized how annoying the timer at the top of the page is watching it tick away while thinking of something to write ( which should not be a problem anyway since i'm supposed to write what i'm thinking and not the other way around ) just seems to get on my nerves a bit i wonder what the rest of the writing assignments this semester will be like though they need to fix this page up though , it did not work in my primary web browser , mozilla firefox , and i do not like internet explorer all that much oh , the music just changed , it 's a bit faster and slightly more aggressive now i got myself some candy too , though i probably should not have since i will be having lunch in a bit it 's getting a bit warmer in here , someone probably increased the air conditioner temperature again and now my roommate is playing basketball outside in the living room one of these days i think he 's going to break something 10 minutes and the clock 's ticking i really should get some work done today i pretty much wasted the last two days , but hey , what are three day weekends for i have got some math and cs homework , as well as a freshman seminar paper math 's an interesting class even if it is too easy not to sound self deluded , but i do think i know more calculus than most people in that class , at least so far computer science is a different story though the class is a bit harder than i expected it to be , but nothing beyond me a little googling and i should easily be able to look up anything i do not already know and complete the assignment java is not really one of my strengths , but that does not mean i ca not make it one i like psychology though , at first i thought it would be impersonal and intimidating because of the sheer number of students in it but that 's changed 17 minutes i just have to continuously keep looking at the timer and the music just stepped up , now it 's a bit faster than before and i actually got this paper done ! i'm so proud of myself ! well , not really , but i'm glad i got it done anyway and now my mind 's a blank really looks like my time 's up did i mention i hate popups time to click the finish button
2004_257.txt 0 1 0 0 0 well , i wonder why i'm here languages can be a real problem especially when you have 100 pages to read every day maybe this is what people called college live no time , no entertainment , no nothing maybe it 's not the case for native students ! so why am i here am i anywhere better than them or will i ever be better than this advantaged people what advantage will i receive once i finish this college hell hell with it it 's not so bad actually maybe i do not know there are so many things i want to do , but do not have time for i have to fit into the class room , so i got to read the textbook , pretending that i'm cool with it who knows how i'm doing i do not even know that sometimes i wonder what will come after after all this years of staying and trying to fit into a culture that i do not even like is it money that draw me here or is it something else maybe i'm just tried of what i used to do although i do not know exactly what live repeats itself , again and again that i do not know whether i have done it already or it 's just a similar experience memories are tricky they fool you , mislead you , and abandon you am i here for the 2nd time or even more than that what am i searching for trying to reach a perfect life i wonder how many times more do i have to live in order to achieve that enough for the questions since there will be no answers to that austin is a nice place the weather is quite similar to taiwan , but not as humid people are busy , as they did in community college but the more people there are , the easier you fall into isolation i do not remember when i get my first friend in college , but people seemed more relaxed back then memories make things look at its best that 's how human survives cell phone is also a devise that 's supposed to do so but do they people get more and more dependent on such thing they want to be connected but with whom what 's the meaning of saying hi on the phone and trying to find a correct time to hang up though out the conversation cell phone is tiring they only work when you need to be picked up there lots of quite asian girls on campus i wonder where they are from are they having the same troubles i do not see any good looking asian guys out there too bad , it 's always easier to find good looking girls than guys well , as long as it nurture my eyes not being able to see good looking things can be a torture ! that brings me to another problem in austin no comic book store ! ! ! and i ca not even watch the dvds i brought damn capitalistic americans region settings is plane stupid
2004_259.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you ca not be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor well i got back from a bible study got to see some people that i have not seen in a while i suppose it made me feel at home and i actually made plans to hang out with someone i met this summer and have not been able to see him that much anyways i enjoyed it but at the same time i wonder about my relationship with god i suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind is it strong enough to i pursue him enough am i a good person sometimes i do not know so i'm listening while i do this music seems to be something that i have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words , now even though some music does not appeal to me i believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations so lets get real i'm an 18 guy so i do also think about girls quite a bit today i thought of a girl in high school i missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend even though i do not know what the hell i want to be honest , is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy , who are we trying to impress i do not know but i ca not deny my feeling i believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life sometimes i feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that 's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others , live life love life so as i continue to right i remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life i find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each other simple glances are rarely seen what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life so many lonely people what do i like the smell of rain , the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins , the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living i met an 80 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he did not want it to end i agree some people have forgotten that but i hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for , someone to love , something to give , man being a kid was freaking awesome and i could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing i wish i had a glass of milk before i went to bed but hey what can you do well there went 20 minutes i suppose i will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry garcia live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful
2004_260.txt 0 0 0 1 1 how much time do i have before i need to do some more homework this week is going to be pretty busy it is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out all the teachers should use the same service this would make it much easier for students to keep up my goal is not to fall behind , but i have missed some classes of geology i need to find out what i missed that class is going to suck i wish i had a car so that i could get places farther than a mile away i hate writing i hate typing it is hard to write down everything you think our minds work 5 or 6 times faster than one can type or speak so if we could talk faster , we could get up to 5 times the amount of information to someone else , leaving us with more free time this would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating i'm glad my spider bite went away it sucked that i had to go to the health center for it they gave me a shot in my ass it left a bruise , but it did not hurt until an hour or so later it just sucked that it was on my face it made me nervous when i heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because i had been putting it on for many days thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm i spend much time alone now that i moved away luckily i enjoy being by myself it is nice to have the peace and quiet the parties are fun , it is just that i would prefer to chill with just my friends , not a million people that i do not know i do not know too much about bull fighting , most other sports i have played i do not see the glamour , passion , and joy of bullfighting it seems barbaric to use ones instincts
2004_261.txt 0 1 0 0 0 the weekend was nice an old family friend came up to visit i have known him since 3rd grade i think something like that bowling bumming around gaming pool eating etc etc was fun now back to class after a long weekend ugh these classes are not very interesting but that 's ok it 's just basic sequence right now once i start taking major sequence classes i think it will become more interesting these classes just seem like a hassle i never liked writing assignments mostly because i have never been a strong writer i'm not very skilled at thinking of what to write words never seem to flow i do not know i really wonder what i will do with my life biomedical engineering sounds all fancy and stuff but will it really provide me with a decent life in the future i really do not know it does not seem like there 's much flexibility with this major i do take cem , phys , bio courses and stuff so it seems like my work covers over areas from different majors i guess i will have a wide variety of knowledge but i wo not be an expert in any of the areas plus with competition from foreign sources the future scares me even more i guess i do get somewhat bitter when i think about how researchers may earn something like 40 50k a year but then the mba that hired them gets 100 perhaps that 's just bs i do not think it 's very fair at all but nothing 's ever very fair man i really want a job i have time i guess but no transportation and then not all the jobs i have looked through were at the right times i applied for something at the lan cave in jester i hope i get that then i need to start looking for scholarships internships summer research etc etc etc oh yeah i need to look for an apartment for next year i really do not want to end up in the dorms again as much as i like the fast internet i really want a room of my own and the freedom that comes with living in a place of your own i guess it is pretty free in the dorms but i ca not blast the music when i want to or turn up the volumes for gaming besides blanton is not really the best dorm out there either not having a sink in the room really sucks it 's not a big deal to walk to the bathroom but for stuff like making ramen a quick wash of the face or maybe just a drink of cool water i have to make a trip i guess i'm just lazy but it 's odd that some dorms have sinks in the room and others do not only ten minutes have passed feels like a lot more than that time passes slowly when you are not having much fun i like seeing things animated or in motion sitting and writing or reading they are not that interesting i do like reading about computer technology and astronomy and cars and stuff but it 's hard to make myself sit down and read a book like harry potter i have not done that in years yeah i do not think i have willingly read a fiction book since middle school i remember those redwall and mossflower books i guess they were the trend back in the day i signed up for the 3rd coast gaming competition later this month aiya i'm a bit worried playing at the arcades is not like playing on a console the controls feel different plus when i play at the arcades i get beaten a lot i guess it kind of hurts my confidence but that 's ok i will just see how i match up with the other people in the competition besides it 's only 10 and i think it will be fun to watch the l337 play i could really go for a huge huge glass of orange juice right now maybe some pluckers wings too i do not know what should i write about anything at all it 's so vague i like having a little more of an idea of what i'm doing shrug oh well do not use this as a cry for help huh i do not really cry out for help well not in very noticeable ways keeping secrets hurts you huh i guess i have probably shortened my life a lot then aiya being asian that 's my excuse the guy is not really supposed to show weakness heh what a stupid way of thinking but after 18 years it 's hard to break the habit i wonder how people can be so carefree i hope the year goes well i really do too much tension everywhere i really just want to break lose and forget all the responsibilities i have but i do not think i can it 's just not something i would do i'm tired i need to find something someone amazing i do not want to just cruise through life
2004_262.txt 0 0 1 1 0 well i am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day , all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it 's really quiet in here , which is actually really nice considering i hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff too bad that i have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study i will be leading for kappa that i have little time to rest i really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because i have so much going on that i feel guilty if i am not always being productive i know that i need to take time every day just to sit with god and tell him what is going on in my mind so that 's what i want to do with this exercise i am going to type everything i think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to god i hate that i feel like i constantly need to be watching my money , or what i eat , or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like i am making wise decisions , why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups i know i human , and that i am sinful and that i ca not do anything on my own so i do not know why i get disappointed in my failures , why should i expect anything else i feel pretty guilty about how much time i put into some of my relationships as well , like i wish i was there for lauren f more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her i also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life , i need you to make me aware of when i start to count calories ( eaten or burnt ! ) or when i start to keep a constant tab on how much i spend or what people owe me lord i want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something i deserve because i know that i do not ! i also know that i need to take a nap this afternoon if i want to get any work done later so i pray that i would be able to do that as well i have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what 's important you and my family and friends and everyone else in my life lord i want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment i feel really excited about this year but it 's discouraging when i can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff i really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment , but what can you do ! i hate that i was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they are having communicating , i am also so worried about david , mp , and nancy , i just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you lord , and understand your love for them i wish i knew what to expect on this phl test coming up on thursday , but there i go again with wanting to know things before the right timing i am worried that i am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as i should be but i know that i am doing the best i can and they should not be consuming my life i am so glad i got to spend time with ford this weekend and i really hope that he does not have a flight delay because of the rain here and in atlanta because i know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back but i know he was supposed to be here this weekend and i am so glad that he got to talk to chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about i feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason i am really upset that the tuna fish i bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts , because that cost what , maybe 4 come on louise you are so cheap get over it ! ! ! surprisingly i am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but i know that i need to be really giving that to you and i really hope it does not all hit me at once tomorrow i am really hot so i had to go turn on the fan i wonder when becca and martha are getting back , is it wrong that i kind of like that they are not around right now why is it that i like to be alone so much , is it selfishness i am kind of worried about kyle maybe liking me , i really do not want him to , because i really love having him as a friend and i really do not know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason i have been getting that vibe lately so i really hope that i can act in a way that does not lead him on but that is still nice man that 7up stuff i got is disgusting ! ! ! why do i always try those things healthy soft drinks ! ! what a joke ! ! ! of course it 's going to taste awful i really hate that i am always feeling like i need to be repaid when i do something for someone i mean seriously ! why ca not i just give out of love and show like grace like christ did to us i am really excited about this psych class though because it will be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career i am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep i got on saturday i really need to get rest because i know i do not get nearly enough , help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you did not make us require so much sleep for nothing ! i just wish i would enjoy it i pray that i could have a peace so that i could sleep right now
2004_265.txt 1 1 0 0 1 last night i laid down and i could not go to sleep for anything sleep would be nice right now , i have class all day today my classes are pretty cool though i have music psychology and ceramics i'm good at ceramics though cause i got grounded a lot in high school high school was fun i have a lot of great memories i miss my friends sometimes , but it was time to move on i feel more free , no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are i am finally realizing the value of that too i think its the art i love art its constantly running thorough my head the way i look at everything , the way i find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things , the way i am so attracted to things that are gorgeous not only on the outside but personalities for example and music i am going to incubus on wednesday and they are brilliant its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways my music class meets too often 4 days a week that shit is ridiculous i feel like i am taking 15 hours but i'm just taking 12 , which allows for a job i am going to work at the frank erwin center hopefully i was a waitress this summer at el chico i love mexican food i am so damn hungry right now oops can i cuss oh well my stomach is rumbling and i felt it necessary i feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un explainable believe me lately i have been dead set on being responsible and i am hell bent on making all a 's , so when i can make a check on the 'old to do list , its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke my back hurts so bad every day from stress its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because i was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc and i could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks , and now that i have gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier its so much easier just being a sophomore in general i remember when i moved into the dorms my freshmen year we moved everything in and i remember after my dad left standing there looking around i had no phone , no friends , and no clue and i think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life but when i look back i have learned that you ca not always know everything at that second you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all what is this an autobiography i do not know i am just writing as i go along i like to write i write often actually , sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about i like to vent , i need to vent its almost like when i write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out i do not know maybe i'm weird i wish i could find really unique ways of expressing myself , so i do poetry as well but i am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another how about love i am in love i am not quick to say that either and it is not something i was trying to do or even wanted , but i have found my soul mate believe it or not he is perfect , and believe me i am not naive he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the adhd ) and i love his mind because i appreciate things i cannot understand myself or find how its done , and he fascinates me really all i want is to be fascinated , and to laugh i love to laugh you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry man that 's the best seriously that 's why i like to surround myself with people who make me laugh i make myself laugh too i am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks i love that
2004_266.txt 0 0 0 0 1 right now i am doing this psychology ut what will i be doing in the next couple seconds oop , my roommate just walked in and i have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time hard ! my room mate said hi and i am having trouble responding to him , it looks like stephanie is impressed with my bass all right you all have a good one roommate has left , that is weird i wonder what misung shin yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and stephanie are going to do together , probably nothing much , i can hear my roommate , err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 2005 until the wee hours of the morning which does not really bother me but i think it might a little , who knows its probably just something to complain about i want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with david but i do not have his number so maybe ill call mom and dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me , i got to do the psychology experiment before saturday i do not really understand the experiment system but i think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well i have been going on for a while now and i still have a ways to go , phooey i like my psych teacher though , he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting oh man i think i accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well i will just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good , and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology i was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if i could ever be a professor who really really knew his stuff do i work hard enough i think i do , i been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but i have been working too another thing that i ca not escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind , yet maybe i think about it more than others i think about whether or not i'm too picky i have not ever gone with a girl for longer than like 2 months i really ca not stand the thought of a girlfriend , i have not really met a girl that i'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks i have already had some opportunities but i just straight decided i did not ' want to go with them why you know it has to do with looks i probably seem really shallow but i just want a chick who looks damn good not just good if i find myself thinking of reasons why i do not like you the fact of the matter is i'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late i have ditched some really cool people and i feel bad about it but then i have been ditched too sometimes i think i have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you do not want to be somebody 's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so i need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date , do not worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that 's what i say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she 's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things do not just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people i think i will ask kim and liz if they

2004_267.txt 1 1 0 0 1 this is the weirdest thing i have ever had to do right now my roommate is watching the graham norton effect and it is hard to concentrate the show is really funny he just changed the channel i am going to ask if could turn it down a little yesterday i had a really good date it is all i can think about today i hope things turn out good because i do not want to be hurt i went to the gym today i like and dislike working out i like the end result and the feeling after working out , but i hate the feeling before i have start working out i want to go out tonight i do not have class on fridays so i feel obligated to go out and do something i got some people to go salsa dancing nobody has really confirmed f they are going or not i kind do not want to go anymore , but since some people already said yes i have to go i am sure i will have tonight this is really strange i am just spilling out random thoughts i really like the guy i went on date with well i do not know if i like him or if i like the idea of being with him i guess time will show i am tired of being single i want a boyfriend ! i was at the gym and i felt for some reason really aroused i usually do not get aroused at the gym but today i saw a really hot guy that i could not get out of my head i wonder if that is bad thing to like a guy but still be really turned on by other guys i know it is perfectly normal but i would have tired something with this guy if he had asked me to maybe that 's why people think i am whore i m really sexual i am really worried about getting in the communication school i think about everyday if i do not get in i do not know what i will do if i do not get in i just had dinner by myself i hate eating by myself i think it is because i had no friends when i was growing up i have friends now but tend to want them around to much i want to have sex i hope ya will do not read this because are going to think the worst of me , but at the same time i do not what anybody thinks of me for the most part i keep looking at the clock to see how much time i have left i hope i am doing this right because if i am not than i will be really mad my is cool but he tends to be an ass sometimes he was just over my shoulder reading this i told him not too and then he stop he is watching seinfeld now i wish i could enjoy the show right now wait no he is watching the king of queens my mistake i can concentrate now because i do not like that show i have a lot of pretty friends
2004_268.txt 0 0 1 1 0 man today was a really long day i'm a so tired but i have all this crap to do still mostly calculus i do not know why i took 408d its so freaking hard i hope i will do okay because i just have to i signed up for tutoring but i do not know how much that will help i like this cd i'm listening to i have listened to it a million times but still like it man i'm really upset that alias is not coming on this season i love that show it was one thing i was looking forward to this semester i wish i could be like sydney and kick butt but instead i'm really boring man i am so freaking tired the bathroom has gotten really disgusting i do not want to be the only one to clean it but i do not want to be the only one to complain that its dirty i hate cleaning toilets i mean it would be okay if it were at home because that 's like our toilet and i kind of know the germs around but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek i just ca not think about it with out cringing college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to i guess i will get used to it its going okay so far i mean its fun and all but i do not know i really really miss home its weird not coming home to your family everyday i have met some really cool people but i still miss my old friends but i'm getting used to going places by myself woo hoo i'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom sheehs its only been 5 minutes i do not know how much more i can type this is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha i am typing what i am thinking so hey my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping wait i missed my favorite song on the cd oh well i wish asthma were here with me we could do some awesome stuff together but amrita seems really cool we have had great convos but i'm still scared to make new close friends like i loved my friends from hs we were such good friends making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over its hard for me i'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere i feel really alone sometimes in a room full of people but i guess that 's natural wow its only been 8 min and 48 seconds but i should not complain this is better than doing limits in calculus lord calculus i'm so worried i have to do good i have to after this i should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk tomorrow is discussion so it should not be so bad but i'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which is not good when i'm totally clueless its embarrassing but i guess i'm not the only one some people did not know the answers either the only thing is that in the class there 's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything the class would be tons easier if i knew someone in there to help me but there is morty he 's in a diff class but he says he will help me he 's so freaking nice he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though i can be boring haha i think he feels bad for me because i'm not adjusting as well as him to college he 's having like the time of his life so many friends and places to go i should keep my self busy so i wo not get so lonely i'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous i want to run for office but its so scary for some reason i have second thoughts about everything i have no idea why i wonder where my roommate went she works out everyday its inspiring i should too i will go to the gym haha i will try who knows if i actually will i went once and really liked it but i just have to find time it seems like i have boatloads of work but college is good i will get through it i just do not know why people say its the best time of their lives so far it just seems alright who knows i still have at least 4 years i'm so sleepy 5 more minutes of this and then calculus no time to sleep ooh i need to watch rnc tonight i missed last night but laura bush was there it might of been interesting even though i'm not much for republicans everything lately is so political its funny in every class discussion there is some mention of elections like in psychology the polls were really interesting how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush who knows if its actually true but i think there 's some validity to it sigh i'm going home this weekend i'm excited i'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird haha that 's what 's cool about being indian parents can always find some other indian kid to drive you home oh well i'm so tired there 's only 2 minutes to go this was actually cool and stress relieving you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out oooh asthma just imed me i have not talked to her in a while damn she hangs out with matt clark now i find that to be so freaking funny who would of thought anyways man all i can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha i like dreaming lately i have weird dreams last time i had this nightmare
2004_270.txt 0 0 1 1 0 i have realized that my computer at home is a lot slower than my cool computer at school i miss my computer at school , but at least this one does not have annoying pop ups like that one ah ! i am angry at christina for downloading a stupid program onto my computer that had hidden programs i am at home right now and i am happy , i miss being able to shower without shower shoes on everything is a lot more clean too , at least that is how i feel i think that that 's just because i am used to home oh my god my typing skills have deteriorated i think so have my spelling skills my head itches and i just washed my hair so now its dripping all over my shirt , because i am too lazy to blow dry my hair speaking of which i need to bring my blow dryer to school so i do not sleep with wet hair because that gives me headaches today on the bus back home i was feeling nauseous hmm i do not think i spelled that right because i was reading my psychology reading hehe that 's what i'm writing this essay for anyways i was feeling like i you know having to capitalize all the it 's is very annoying and my weird keyboard is not helping very much either o yah so i decided to take a nap so i would not throw up i miss my house i hope tomorrow i will be able to hang out with my old friends who are still at home ! many of them have left already except the ones going to west coast schools lucky people they are , except they will still be in school in june when all of us are out ! i told daddy about the normandy scholar program that i was interested in , but i knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply i think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes , but i know it is for my own good because oh ! i might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me , but seriously , if i get into a really bad accident there should be people in europe who would help me by the way the normandy scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in europe going to old world war ii sites and you learn about world war ii , which i think is interesting partially because i seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff , maybe that 's why i like ender 's game so much but i also like band of brothers ! which got me interested in world war ii in the first place ! and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war , but more like a battle i'm thinking about bringing my dvd 's to school , but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because i will want to watch them instead of studying , like how my roommate and i stayed up until 2 30 for the past 2 nights watching chinese soap operas i think it 's really funny because i am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them , like when you watch anime , speaking of which i need to see if the next full metal alchemist episode is out or maybe i will just borrow it from my buddy she 's crazy but i like how she is protective of me so i know that i hopefully wo not get into any scary trouble ! hehe it 's like , now that i am away from my family at least i have someone i can trust to be there for me most of the time i hope i think i do not know maybe not that much yea my hair is getting dry and now i have a piece of hair on my hand i seem to be shedding a lot but i think that is normal because everyone else i have talked to say that it happens to them too i just do not like how every time i wash my hair big wads of hair come out i feel like i'm going bald , except i still have tons of hair , which makes me wonder how do i still have this much hair yet lose so much hair every time i wash my hair because it takes a while for new hairs to grow as long as the old ones right i wonder how much hair do we really have on our heads i miss my sister and her friends this summer was really fun even though i was only in california for about a week i really felt like i belonged there it just seems so hard to go out and meet new people i think i'm too shy around strangers if i acted like myself when i'm with friends around people i do not know maybe it will be easier to make new friends but i am afraid that eek i think i feel that i have a headache coming on but i feel that i will scare people away but i mean if i'm going to be their friend they will eventually find out that that 's the way i am right i guess yay only about three more minutes to go i think my contacts are getting kind of foggy i should blink more i wonder do hard contacts yah they do but i think they get more dry quicker than soft contacts i think they might be dirty but would not that make my eyes hurt maybe i do not know i always cringe when they fall into the sink ! ew so gross and to think that i'm putting these into my eyes everyday ! i forgot to bring my sucker thing home just incase my contacts got stuck in my eyes but i guess it 's okay because i hope guess think they wo not get stuck so i did not really forget i just say i did it 's kind of like i'm like a pathological liar then i do not know it 's just easier to say things and not have to explain them because then people get bored and are like why are you telling me this so i just lie to make it easier i wonder if that 's bad like i remember the time that my friend called me really late at night and wanted to talk for no apparent reason now my time is up !
2004_272.txt 0 1 0 1 0 ok , it 's labor day what a great day good thing because i needed to do a lot of homework geez , calculus is so easy but they give us too much homework that baja place really sucked that 's not mexican food at all ! it was way too expensive for the way it tasted that dog commercial was funny ! i have been eating too much domino 's pizza lately i'm going to lose all my muscle and just get fat if i keep it up halo was awesome last night 3 hours for one mission ! that 's crazy but it was so much fun that girl i met is so cool she 's different , and i like that hmm , if i try too hard she wo not like that and she will get scared off if i do not try at all she will think i do not like her girls are so freaking confusing that chick had a guys name mr pennebaker is pretty cool and funny i thought it was going to suck at first oh my god that psychology book is starting to get really hard to read the next chapter talks about all the parts of the brain and i do not think my brain will be able to remember all that stuff i wonder if that puppy turns girls off hmm oh well if they do not like it i do not care i should get more water because its starting to run out is weed really that bad hmm , why do so many people do it i do not know but i do not think it 's that bad alcohol is probably worst and that 's legal my hand is starting to hurt and it 's only been like 6 minutes i miss my car it was so freaking fast going 125 on the highway was freedom now i'm really stressed out and do not know how to relieve it i want to play halo again i'm going to try to call her again in like an hour i hope she is not too busy man i should just wait for her to call me , what if she starts hating me for trying too hard i want to eat mcdonalds later on and some ice cream damn , then i have to go run for an hour why am i starting to hate that it used to be my favorite thing to do well probably because there are so many better things to do here church was ok the singing and piano were freaking awesome ! it was a little boring though mass in spanish is better for me i have to go look for one soon that will be better if god does not exist that would suck that means when we die we just die we ca not dream anymore , we ca not think , or do anything we just do not exist i ca not even imagine that because when i am sleeping i am still thinking what would it feel like to no longer be in existence well you would not really feel anything i'm answering a lot of my own questions why does pennebaker want us to do this he has his professional degree he must be pretty damn smart maybe he is studying us every time we go into his class i miss my dog i hope he is in doggy heaven now i hate cats , why do not they like me hey it 's robert , i'm going to go answer the door ok lets turn on the tv only 8 minutes left pp pp shee pp pp shee he 's busting a beat it sounds pretty good i like coke better than pepsi how can anybody not like adam sander he is so funny and so is that guy on that god movie what was it called hmm hmm oh yeah bruce almighty what was his name ace ventura no that is not it hmm oh yeah jim carrey he is funny too old but funny wow will smith looks good for him being so old and all i want to keep looking that young when i get old music is awesome i have learned so much about what i like since i have gotten here i think i'm going to learn a lot about myself in this college i'm glad i got accepted actually i like that i got that full scholarship man mad tv is funny they are really good actors i hope people do not think they are losers because it is really hard to keep a straight face and act so well we are going to go eat again yummy ! i hope it is like a burger place or something kinsolving food is pretty good the people there are also really nice that black guy is hilarious he is really friendly too i wonder when i have to take that test for the business school i think i failed it the last time i took it god she is so pretty both of them why are girls like that why do they lead you on even now she is leading me on is the new girl my girlfriend now we do everything that couples do we go out in public together and everyone has seen us does that make us an item maybe i'm not sure if i want a girlfriend here in college but the companionship of a female is really good having a good girlfriend is hard to find i hope that girl i met last week will be good friends with me i can learn so much from her but she is too attractive and it will be really hard for me to just be friends with her i have already kissed her she let me , so what does that mean maybe just friends that think they are attractive she probably did mean that she does not want a boyfriend well girls are so confusing 20 minutes up , time to go eat later
2004_275.txt 1 1 0 0 1 this summer has been such a burden on me i am dwelling in it and it is eating me up i do not know why exactly we broke up i just know that it was completely out of place and unexpected i find myself digging myself deeper and deeper into it and not really caring what it is doing to me i just ca not seem to let it go it might be because we were together for so long and go so close she was the best person god had ever put in my life we seemed to click , it seemed so perfect , and she told me she felt the same she told me a couple weeks before she left me that this being her longest relationship was starting to trigger her flight reflexes she was scared she told me i meant to much to her and that the relationship meant to me to her she had just come to terms with the fact that she was in love with me something she had not let herself do with anyone else before me it felt so right i was at such a high , life was so good i was happier than i had ever been i became so dependant on her for happiness i know that is something that was unhealthy , but she had gotten just as dependant on me we had so many plans for the future we planned out every step of the way factoring in everything including my going off to college and her finishing up her last year in high school everyone is telling me to move on , but she told me before she left that if anything ever happened between us , for me not to let her go she wanted to get through this hell or high water nothing was going to tear us apart during the summer we got closer than ever we had many plans for the summer we bought tickets to concerts then she went off to camp she said nothing was going to happen at camp four days into it she calls me and tells me that she can no longer be with me what the hell happened at camp i go to warped tour and she with someone else all i can do is give her a hug and say nice pick over 6 feet tall and blonde , just like i said seeing as i was joking around with her a few weeks before saying that she would leave me for someone of that exact same description later she calls me and tells me it was not what it looked like i blew up on her it was a normal reaction everything she said before camp got my hopes soaring , and then bang , everything comes crashing down everyone tells me that she probably found someone up there and i completely defended her cause i knew her better than anyone else , not only my thoughts but hers as well she was just afraid of commitment because she had been hurt so much in the past every male figure in her past had let her down , and she could not comprehend someone loving her as much as i did so because all the idiots in her past , i have to be let go because she ca not handle commitment even after all the time we spent together why did she have to go , we were happy i do not know what happened at camp it was more than seven weeks ago that i talked to her i called this week and left a message she did not return i called again today she picked up we talked for 18 minutes and 36 seconds she seems perfectly happy , just as free as a freaking butterfly , not caring at all , it seems , about what i am feeling how is it that she can be so freaking happy being alone and i'm sitting hear eating myself up and being miserable is everything that has happened a game to her i do not understand how i can move past this i ca not i do not what to do i gave her everything and it feels impossible to get it back i still love her more than i love anyone , including myself all i can do is sit and write songs about it
2004_278.txt 0 0 1 0 0 it is interesting to note that when i work on something in my head , i always forget what the details were unless i write it down one thing i do remember though , are the feelings i feel like what i had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability , particularly in math with this i acn create a continuation , or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge this would help me learn a lot more on my own , rather than starting over as much as i do on particular problems the only problem is i do not know how to keep a good organized notebook , rather i havjust not done it yet i can keep things very well organized when i want t , but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do i wish i could find a way to ake a lot of things easier speaking of which , i always make things easier in math i always say that i am so good at some things because i make those things much easier than most people make them i do this because i am lazy simply put , i work on something to make it easier for me in the future ultimately i get easier work tat way , so i am a lazy , yet slightly thoughtful person thoughtful in the way of thinking , not as in the consideration of others well my roommate walked in the room , so my stream of consciousness is screwed so hi ! ! well , anyways what was i talking about stuff ohhhh my laziness that 's a long subject i am very lazy , but i really need to work on my laziness i am trying to do this , my mental laziness is not very bad , but physically i do not do as much as i like so , i guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing i am going to try flag football this semester and i really want to play ping pong ( a k a table tennis , as i should probably start calling it ) i was a little ok very upset when i lost so many times the other day , i do not normally play as bad as i did that night i just used a contraction , i was told not to use those in formal apers so i try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment , or even when talking o frieds , apparently i did not follow through with that a few moments ago well , other than that i am kind of at a loss on what to write i am very hungry now , probably has something to do with the food i am smelling i wishi could gain some weight which reminds me , i used to go around saying how much i wanted to be fat , but i quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that my hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep my eyes are shutting too not good when i have 8 minutes and 16 seconds left oh well i want to go eat now i have a lot of homework tonight i wo not get to do anything fun , i wo not ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays , i may have taken too many hours , but then again is college supposed to be asy no its not ( i used that contraction again ) and i forgot the apostrophe , haha anyways college is supposed to be hard so , i should probably enjoy working on homework 6 horus a day , catching up on the weekends while i do laundry , and then on the weekend nights i get time to play ping pong and be with other dean 's scholars people and play intramural football with them speaking of which i played ultimate frisbee the other day err i mean yesterday it was great , it was good to have some more physical activity in my life i scare myself cause my abs well , where i should have abs at least still hurt from limbo three days ago also my legs hurt to my roommate just said scrotum i have no idea why scares me a little more just thought i would let you know that he is nuts , i guess i should go back to what i was tlaking about earlier food haha , i wonder how many words i can type per minute , this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though , cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause i am getting very tired right now , that and i am not punctuating very well , and i am using contractions without the apostrophe 's my roommate just reminded me of george carlin funny man ! ! ! you should atch his stuff sometime , its hilarious i am talking as if there is someone going to read this oh , only a minute and a half left my eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen man , i am hungry ! ! ! ! ! heh , i just looked at the time and it said 19 11 , reminded me of 9 11 , i see that all the time , or at least i used to on the alarm clock , or any clock for that matter , then i got hurt and it no longer showed up
2004_279.txt 0 1 1 0 1 this is kind of new and interesting i have never done my homework like this before i accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening , but the computer is not loading the page so i thought i might atleast complete my writing assignment psychology is such an interesting field to study it is my major in fact at this moment i do not know if i will change though the reason why i chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder i was always told by my parents , since it is genetic , then one day i will have to face the fact that i will also be afflicted with this disorder with my fate already laid out before me , i thought i might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general i never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me i mean , yes , genetics do play a certain role in who the person i am , but i do not think it determines everything i guess this is only part of the whole nature nurture arguement this experiment reminds me of some sort of journal i was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences i go though in my college carrer i am so lazy though , i know i will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then i will probably forget to write in it all together i know it would be beneficial , both psychologically and emotionally if i were to reflect on everyting , but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself a dark haired man just sat near me he did not sit at the computer directly near me i wonder why that is does he think i smell does he think that i will become offened does he find me unapproachable or is he just scared of women i never understood the concept really people tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another i do the same sometimes , but other times i sit next to the person anyway for instance , i sat next the this guy who had a richy rich hair cut in my psych class he was not very charming that 's okay because i was not interested in him in that context anyway i tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation i hope he did not think i was hitting on him because i was not he really is not my type he is in the business school ehh i mean nothing is wrong with that i guess , but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'i want money' nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have , but to focus your life 's carrer on that seems kind of mundane i think money is important , but not as important as knowledge , wisdom , and happiness i guess it is because i grew up having absolutely no money people may say they have no money , but really i have no idea how i ate dinner i was that poor i think it is because of this , i tend to value education i look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity that to me
2004_280.txt 1 0 1 1 1 adrian is rather boring to talk to i called him first and he did not even seem the least bit surprised or even thankful nice oh abby you are so beeeyoootifuuul and so ppeeeerrrrrfect ! ! i bet he likes the attention he gets from imbuing someone adoration maybe that 's the exact reason why i'm attracted to him i'm attracted to the fact that i'm attracted is not that completely vain and shallow too i am ashamed maybe i ca not control it it just does not happen everyday that someone at least pretends to like you for such exaggeratingly good qualities i feel bored i do not want to read 50 pages of some stuff i ca not concentrate on while listening to the tv even if its tv stuff that i do not want to hear i'm listeninng to music finger 11 not anymore i miss caleb , jacob , pinky , ed , michelle , michael , mom , dad , janie , cesar , cynthia , everything is so different from just only 5 years ago we all used to be so close together geographically and familiarly i think this assignment is cool all our writing assignments should be like this the experiment i participated in last week was really boring i thought it would involve something interesting like tasting some product or doing something physical like a handstand and see how gravity affects blowflow to certain body parts that would be a cool experiment it could help those poor astronauts and their whatever space effects huh ! ! they should be helping poor homeless people off the streets its got to be somehting psychological about that because i mean people could work if there 's nothing physical impeding them hten it must be mental or emotional or ptsd my cousin , michelle , said i almost gave her ptsd post traumatic something disorder i thought that was funny i wish i had an awesome sense of humor to make people and myself laugh all the time all i can do is act like my stupid self and that makes people laugh because i'm so naive or ignorant and oblivious to something what kind of ok what really freakin bothers me about the church 's doctrine is the frenching thing its been bothering me for a long time probably longer than it should man , not everyone goes straight to copulation after they french yeah , it may arouse the man or woman , but not really surely not i do not see why we ca not until we are married its showing affection gets to know the other a bit more i guess i do not understand no comprendo ! ! ! i like my immortal by evanescence evanescence is a cool name its a sad song though i wish i could just not have any expectation about guys liking me so when one finally does , finally loves me , then i will be surprised and it will really reallly realllllly count i get so disatisfied i want to go to rome , paris , england , switzerland , russia , romania , i want to speak all their languages ! ! ! ! ! but look here there 's no funding no time for learning all of them i wish i could feel the ever playful presence like in dean koontz 's book one door away from heaven awesome book i have got to do chemistry and finish my calculus calculus is fuuuuuun ! ! ! ! the ta is cool but i do not know what he tries to say when he teaches ! ! ! ! ! he would have been a realllllly cuuuuuuuute guy if he was not gay tooooo baaaad i do not agree with homosexuality takes away from the beauty , sanity , naturality , rightness , sanctity of humanity and the world i ai not never lookin back , and that 's a fact i have got pride i'm taking it for a ride i liketat song i like tiers , i would like a really tiny tier for a pet that would be soooooooo fun and not to mention cooooool dr moreau should have created mini creatures for the future my time is almost up htis was a cool assignment i had a cup of noodle soup i'm really full i feel like i do not have to eat for 3 days maybe i should try that see if i'm a survivor i do not think i would die from that 3 day fast people stay around for longer without food i wish they did not have to

2004_284.txt 1 0 1 1 1 i'm thinking about what i need to do before classes start again , but every time i get started , something interrupts me or i just do not feel like doing it i'm sitting in my room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'wicked soundtrack , it 's amazing my room smelled before , but i cleaned the kitchen so now it does not smell anymore stacy just walked in my room and i yelled at her because i am not supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments i'm feeling kind of gross , actually i feel gross because it 's the end of the weekend and i was out partying the whole time i hate when people are like , yeah i party , but i seriously did the whole weekend now i feel dirty and gross i also ate like crap this whole weekend ew during the week i'm so healthy and so conscious of what i eat , and then the weekend comes and it 's like i have never seen food before what is that about so now i feel gross because i feel like i ate the entire state of texas and i'm disgusting i will get over it i kind of miss camp right now , even though i would never go back i miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg those three are like my favorite people in the world this time seems to be going by so slowly i feel like i have been writing forever and i have not weird so back to camp i miss it because i was so comfortable and so happy here , i'm not used to everything yet and i miss those three girls because i know that they will always be there and i have known them forever i'm still getting to know people here , which is fun because i love to meet new people , but sometimes i long for that feeling of comfort and not having to impress or look good for anyone you know what i mean and i also miss adam this is something i could talk about for a while but i do not really know if i want to it 's our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that i sent him wo not get there on the 8th , i feel kind of bad about that what can i do it was so weird when ross called me the other night , what the f i'm running out of things to talk about i love traci , my suitemate i knew her from camp and i'm really glad we decided to live together despite what everyone said , i knew it would be a good decision we have been getting along really well i'm thinking about friends right now because it 's my favorite show i love it so much , and i'm so sad that it 's over but i'm excited to watch joey on thursday i'm definitely going to support him even if the show sucks , though i doubt it will this is random but i'm going to run out of soap and shampoo soon , i'm going to have to go to eckerd 's to buy more , and i need to return some books to the co op outlet because there were some books that i did not need hopefully i will get store credit , and then i can buy some stuff that would be awesome ! i need to return my chemistry and old psychology book i found out that i was in the chemistry class for science majors , and let me tell you that i'm the furthest thing from a science major i hate science well i do not hate it but i definitely do not belong in that class so i switched into chemistry in context which is for sure more my pace and i actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and i found out that i bought the wrong book i just figured something out about me i hate bad spellers so random , i know , but i see myself typing and every time i'm about to spell something wrong or i mistype , i get so angry i do not know how people can just leave words mispelled i hope nobody reads this because they will think i'm such a weird kid which i am , but not everyone needs to know that my brother , danny , always tells me i'm a weird kid he 's so funny and whenever i talk about him to other people , they always ask how old he is , and then they are surprised when i tell them that he 's 16 , because the way i talk about him , it sounds like he 's older danny always gives me orders and bosses me around , but in a funny way , not in a serious way people always make fun of our family by calling us the brady bunch because no one ever seems to fight in my family i do not know why , but we all just get along my older sister is my best friend in the entire world sure , we get annoyed with each other every once in a while , but she is absolutely the first person that i go to with a problem and she 's the first person i tell things to and danny is awesome there 's nothing not to like about him he 's so cute , nice , smart , funny , he 's a great catch some day , girls are going to fall all over him they should me and andi ( my sister ) always say that we would date danny if he was not our brother he 's such a cute kid i'm kind of mad at him though because i have not talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and he did not i hate when people do that i really do not know what else to talk about i guess i can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then i will have plenty to say i hope that 's still following the assignment so i will start with olivia geyelin i do not even know why i'm writing about her because she sucks i mean , i hate this girl she might be the dumbest person i know , and she 's always complaining and never knows what 's going on she gets mad at everyone for the dumbest reasons ew but i kind of feel bad for her because she 's got the worst family life ever ok i'm sick of olivia , now i will talk about rikki spreckman ok , i used to love rikki , she was so sweet and nice and always smiling and then i realized how selfish and dumb she was i hate sounding like a bitch but i' m starting with the people i like the least and working my way to the good ones ok so rikki , sweet girl , adorable , but so dumb and she 's best friends with hillary , who i will come back to later , but it annoys me because hillary 's one of my best friends and i hate how much time they spend together i'm not jealous , i just know that hillary could do so much better than rikki , but rikki seems to need hillary and i feel bad for hill because a lot of people do not like rikki , and so they are always talking about her and then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too , which is so not true but i have known rikki since junior high ok now on to sarah salon i used to hate sarah she 's a bitch not kidding and she 's intimidating as hell , but only if you take her seriously now i like her a lot more because i'm not scared of her and i do not take her shit she has two older sisters who might be the meanest people ever , and she tries to act like them but she 's so much better than them sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time , and so her and i were always able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships she 's always so much fun to be around i like her but her and rikki had this whole feud going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she hated her i'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because i really feel like i have been doing this forever and every time i'm typing , it seems like the seconds do not go by , but every time i pause , the seconds go by quickly maybe it 's in my head , i do not know but it 's weird i'm going to start looking at another clock to see how much time has gone by ok after sarah , i only have favorites left everyone else left , i genuinely love , they are my best friends i will start with lizzie albert elizabeth chandler albert i met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best friends i'm not kidding , i loved her so much and we could always talk about anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous and we were always on the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same ( but she was smarter ) in our group of friends , we were the smartest we were bff , i swear and then junior year , our friends kind of got in this fight and we did not talk for a really long time it really bothered me i'm not joking it killed me that she did not want to talk to me and i did not understand it was so bad we were never the same again but at the end of senior year , we got close again , and now i think we are really close , like reverting back to three years ago i miss her so much , she goes to wisconsin she 's probably having the best time i ca not wait to go visit her she 's so funny , i always have a great time whenever i'm with her love her ok after lizzie comes simone i met simone actually a long time ago maybe in 1997 she came to camp and we were good friends , we were in the same cabin then she stopped going to camp and i did not see her again until i was in high school then we became best friends i love simone she cracks me up and is so great we finish each other 's sentences , she reminds me of my mom so much , she 's like another sister to me we took this class together called 20th century history and literature , and it was the best class that i have ever taken i'm so glad that we were able to be in that class together i hate sounding cheesy but it 's true there 's no one i would rather be in 20th with than simone simone 's dad died the day before her 5th birthday , and so she lives with her mom she has two sisters , so the four girls are pretty close her mom works all the time so i feel like simone 's ahead of all of us , she 's already an adult she does things by herself and is really mature love her she goes to bradley which is so good for her i really hope she 's happy she rocks my world after simone comes marisa love marisa we always knew each other but were not really friends until about sophomore year then the end of junior year and all of senior year we were like inseperable we were best friends me , simone , lizzie and marisa were a foursome she 's so funny , so sweet , loooooves to talk i love her family and going over to her house because i always have a good time when i'm there marisa was the kid who was on the fast track , if you know what i mean she had sex when she was 12 or 13 , had a cell phone before everyone , never really had any rules which the exact opposite of me but she 's great and i love her she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after dances and stuff marisa and i went to breakfast every saturday morning of our senior year that makes me so sad that i do not get to do that anymore she goes to indiana , and she loves it both her parents went there and loved it her mom was president of aephi there , so she wo not have any problems getting into the sorority marisa goes with the flow , she 's not uptight or anal about much she 's actually underrated anal but i wo not tell anyone about that love her and last , i will talk about hillary i love her i have known her since the early days at camp marimeta she was always the little girl that everybody loved we did not become friends until we were older and then became like best friends junior and senior year she' so great i honestly love her and miss her so much she wanted to go here so badly and did not get in ass holes but i do not think she would have come here anyways i can talk to hillary about everything i love her she goes to illinois i ca not wait to go visit her she 's so fun and we will have the best time partying , but i also ca not wait to just talk with her and lay on her bed she 's so funny and a great person to be with we are very similar in a lot of ways and i just think that she 's great the first time i came to visit texas she came with me and we were on poms together she was even my big sister one year i miss poms and i miss hill , i need to call her actually because i miss her so much she 's so cute and so talented she 's the best dancer ever and she has a really great voice but she does not really sing anymore sometimes i make her sing to me , but she does not sing for a lot of people ok so now that i only have about a minute left i can talk about adam adam jeffrey silver i met the kid the first day of high school i was like , damn he 's hot we were in like 3 classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other we exchanged phone numbers , he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever since he 's my best friend in the entire world he knows me better than even i know myself and more than my sister knows me he 's so special to me and i know that i'm in love with him and that i will always love him i miss him so much sometimes i do not ' know what to do with myself because i miss him so much but i know it 's the right thing to be with other people right now how else are we supposed to know if we are really right for each other this is the time to find out , you know well , it 's been great see you later
2004_286.txt 1 0 0 1 1 at this very moment i feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what i see everyday for example , there was a notice on my apartment door that i read after coming home from school it stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby when i ride the ut shuttle busses to school , i notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy , nobody thanks the driver and students do not even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency i do not know why i get angry when i think of this , maybe i pay too much attention to things i should not i have always disliked people but loved individuals , but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational enough of that now i am beggining to think of all the things i must do i feel rather confused because i do not know if i should quite my job it is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at antonios tex mex on top of that , i just moved from apartment complexes , and i have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment there is an empty burger king bag infront of me and i feel guilty you see about 1 year and 5 months ago , i used to be very fit , i mean i had it all i'm 6 ft tall , and during that time , i weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle , i was scorching hot that is around the time i meat my girlfriend ( i hope you do not think this is cheesy ) and so we got together about five months passed , and i just ballooned into 265 lbs the reason i stated earlier that i felt guilty for eating the burger was because i am trying to get back in shape and i also feel bad because i know that my partner worries about my health but i do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices i have made in my life , i chose to stay in school and never do drugs , also i have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times , and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days

2004_292.txt 1 0 1 1 1 hello professor , i'm doing your little writing assignment even though i have no clue what to write so ill do what you said to do and wirte about anything that comes to my head today i have to do a lot of study work , not much else to do b c i lifted weights and played bball yesterday for bout 6 hours and now i'm in the ut cycling team and its pretty damn cool i should excel in this sport because i know how to push my body harder than anyone i know , no matter what the test i always push my body harder than everyone else i want to be the best no matter what the sport or event i should also be good at this because i love to ride my bike and to do it as a sport wow lots of fun music hmmm i like it a lot , i have lots of it in fact i have about 15 gb of music on this computer which is about 5 , 000 songs so i have a wide variety of music and that 's good to have , its also good to have know a lot of things which is exactly what i do , i know lots of stuff that nobody else would know i am extremely good at jeopardy and i usually have as much money as the winner and the funny part about it is , they have had college and lots of schooling , most of the contestants were graduate students and i have just begun college by the way my classes are in no way difficult , i hope your class does not get hard because i have a a lot of calculus which is not hard , just very time consuming what to write , haha now that i ask an opportunity has presented itself , a girl that i know just said hi , got me some of that last weekend , i have known her all my life and she looks pretty good too , she goes to tarleton ( redneck city ) but its ok , its still good i have a way with people , if i can talk to them for about 10 minutes i can get them to really like me and if i want to i can make them do almost anything ( no alchohol has to be used ) you can ask my best bud who goes to school here , he knows that i have a way with people and i do that 's what 's so cool about this i have a great life ahead of me and i want to live it to the fullest and no matter what i say on here i ca not stop typing so i will continue and the music is great by the way damn i have got to go home this weekend , everyone misses me too much although i do not miss any of them except this girl that i went out with for bout 2 years , lots of fun there , i love her yes i do and she loves me but since i left we broke up and now she 's trapped with a druggie b c if she dumps him he will either kill himself or me so she 's very scared but i do not care , it will all work itself out in time i just hope it wo not take forever my calculus teacher is skin a real social reject , he has no body mass , he is skinnier than a toothpick and his clothes almost fall off of him its funny to look at that finish button is looking really good right now , as in extremley good , i wish i could click it right now but i ca not b c my 20 is not finished yet so i will continue in my efforts to type and type continuously like you wanted , geez 20 minutes is a long time to just type and have nobody type back to you although i have writted letters that have taken me 3 hours to write and consisted of about 10 pages of paper , but i do not care , i do not care about much anyways , just my grades got to keep them up , i care about my family my future and the girl back home , i care about my frineds , i care about my physical health and looks that 's why i love to be in shape but other than that , i do not care about much of anything , there is no reason to care and by the way i support bush he is a good man and if the media did not give him such a hard rap about things people would like him a lot more the only reason many people do not is because of the media , i even ask them why they do not like him and all they can say is just because , i reeally wisht tthat they would take the time to research things and see who the btter candidate for the president is which is obviously bush ! ! ! anyways i do not really liek the music that is playing right now its not really that cool and has no good beat at all , music is a beautiful artform wchich i believe is the best ever but who cares nobody i am out to change the world and i will you will see mad hatter out
2004_294.txt 0 0 0 1 1 i believe in the future of agriculture , with a faith born not of words , but of deeds better days through better ways that 's all of the creed to the ffa i can rememeber , although i had to recite it for many times i feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because i pay the least rent but i have the most disposable income i'm not sure if i spell a lot of words incorrectly because i'm dyslexic i will say that by typing , my spelling improves my hand writing is horrible i can bearly read the things i write i have worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them man , this room is hot i just turned on the fan but it 's still way too hot i want to take guitar and speed reading classes those are two areas of my life in which i think i drastically need improvement although , none of which are pertinent to my life right now i supose the speed reading class might be i'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes , i do not want to start twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing i wonder how many books have started , or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot i had a dream i thought should be a book the other night , but i ca not remember it my memmory has been getting worse daily not just because of the alcohol consumption i think i'm acutally drinking less now than i did in high school i'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately , and i think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better my girl friend of over a year and a half and i broke up a couple weeks ago , but continued to date the part that bothers me is that i do not have the same free time as she does , so all my free time still goes to her , but she 's dating other people i told her today that i wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes she 's totally against it , and if i were her , i would be too she still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend , and can date other people on the side one of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place i feel this pain inside me i have never felt before when i hear her talking about going places with him but like my roommate says , there 's nothing like a good jam secion he 's talking about music , but i want to jam with some other girls get my mind off of her i know that the migranes and headaches are from her , and that she really is being selfish most of the time , and she 's not really my type , if there is a type for anyone but i find myself unable to stop thinking about her i met another girl the other day who has more incommon with me than anyone i have ever met she 's beautiful and got into ut that means brains and beauty she 's just coming off of a break up from her long time boyfriend through high school as well my main hesitation about persuing her is that i do not want either of us to mentaly , or physically , get involved just because we think we need someone at the moment besides , i think she 's too active for me she 's the social director of her sorority another thing that 's been stressing me out is the fact that my cholesterol is 253 , and my ldl ( the bad kind ) is 183 , higher than most people 's total the doctor told me i needed to get on medication as sooon as possible and gave me sample packages that should last me atleast a month to be sure i had time to get my perscription filled my first thought was to get a second opinion about the medication , but i feel confident that any doctor would tell me the same thing i would tell someone the same thing and i do not have a degree but i ca not convince my self to take it no studies have been done to document the sideeffects of the medication on someone as young as my self when i asked the doctor about them , she said that i should just take half the recomended dosage and i should be okay i decided against the medication and i have drastically changed my eating habbits , althought i did not think they were that bad to begin with i have never been out of shape persay , but i can tell my body 's getting back into shape i used to be very fit , but after quitting high school sports my junior year , i began to slack off and i found the girl that i just recently broke up with , so doing workout stuff did not compare to her i think i'm going to start running soon i'm lifing now more then i get my cardio up , and while it 's helping my muscles get back to looking right , i do not think it 's giving me the help that i need we , the people in my apartment , have decided , because of me , to each by their own groceries i was tired of paying for all the stuff they eat when i would not have any of it i was buying all my stuff extra anyway , and they still wanted me to pay 25 bucks a aweek for community food looks like my time is up adios
2004_295.txt 0 1 1 1 0 usually when you know that you have to do something , you usually think about that something , you usually think about that something and wonder , how am i going to do it where do i start where do i finish how do i know that i am doing it right this is my situation exactly with this writing assignment its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here i ca not wait till saturday because i will attend the first ut football game this season , which i might add , will be my first time to attend one the weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when i was up here for summer school its a real drag i'm always so tired i hate it labor day is this weekend , really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest maybe i will go visit brett ( an el paso friend ) at the hidious a m , college station , the drive is a drag though the road trip that me and lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun , but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me all they are concerned about is putting ut down or tu as they call us since we are not the university of texas but a texas university ! is not it stupid still admit i'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car its sad how immaturity can get the best of people they do have a lot of school spirit makes me wish that i was into that stuff who knows , maybe when all the football games start i want to see how crazy us longhorns really get i ca not wait till softball games start , i want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team ! ! hopefully next year , after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it , i will be ready to try out i'm really discouraged about trying out this year , i know i'm not ready my family 's encouragement helps but i do not want to make a fool out of myself i can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a ut uniform how amazing that is my goal ! ! if i can be one of the best players in my city , why would not i have a shot on the team i just think that i lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level it may be outstanding for high school , but college ball is a totally different game i love being away from home to go to school , there is so much more freedom do not have to be home at a certain time , do not have to check in i love it there are a lot more responsibilities though , but i'm picking up on the time management the incubus concert is coming up and i'm ( since yesterday ) going i have only heard a few songs by them so i ca not say that i'm an all out fan of theirs but hey i'm open to the experience , it 's going to be my first real concert i should really save my money , but hey , why not just do it its worth the experience
2004_298.txt 1 1 1 1 1 so i am overwhelmed i would not say that i'm completely overwhelmed and feel like crying , but i feel a little stressed out i am not used to all this studying and it 's proving to be a little harder than i thought so much reading it seems like it will never end i feel like i will never be caught up i have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math i was worried about math but so far , it 's my easiest class well , i guess it 's good that it 's not hard too my classes are not really difficult but there is just so much reading i'm scared about the first test that i will take i'm afraid that i'm going to make a really bad grade and maybe even fail it i would be devestated so , i'm trying to study a lot it feels like i am studying a lot but i guess i wo not know if it 's all sufficient until that first test man , this is going pretty slow it 's only been three and a half minutes only 17 more to go well , this is the easiest writings that i have had to do so far just write exactly what is going through my head ca not be that hard me and my roommate had our first disagreement last night i promised her that i would not smoke a cigarette at this party and then she caught me taking a drag i felt really bad about lying to her yeah , i was drunk but it was still wrong so , this morning i told her that i was really sorry and blah blah blah she said that it was cool and everything but i do not want it to change our friendship i still want her to be able to trust me i know that it 's just a stupid little fight but it really scares me that she might never trust me like she used to i guess that it will all work out for the best i love austin so much it 's an awesome place to be there are so many good places to eat and shop and just look at my home town only has about 1000 people in it so austin is a good change for me but i do miss my parents and my bed and my shower man , these beds in jester suck i wake up and i'm sore so , i hurt my ankle pretty bad about a week ago we are suing the 7 11 that i tripped at because they handled the situation really badly and treated me very rudly my roommate , dana , was awesome throughout it all i really could not have done it without her i'm glad that we do not hate eachother but i hope that i get some money from the 7 11 it would be nice to be able to pay for an apartment next year with out having to get my parents to pay for it they have 3 kids in college at the same time so it 's going to be a tough year for them , financially dana treats guys really weird i would say , wrong , but it 's just different than i treat guys she 's so wishy washy and is like cheating on all of her boyfriends it kind of bothers me but if that 's the way she is , i ca not try and change her or preach to her about how i think she should be acting man , if my other papers were this easy to write , i would have so much more time on my hands i'm only taking 12 hours , so i feel like a slacker the thing is that if i were taking any more , i think i might cry a lot more when will the reading ever end ! ! ! only 8 more minutes to go wow , this is easy our dorm room used to be freezing cold but i taped some paper over the vent which made it a lot better it 's pretty ghetto looking , but it works i have not been able to exercise for a long time i have to wait until my ankle is better i ca not even wear tennis shoes yet ! man , i feel so lazy and fat when i do not work out exercising makes me feel good ! damn that 7 11 ! and i bought a texercise pass too ! i'm losing some money there i have handicap parking but it runs out on wednesday it 's been really handy ! bont , that 's a word that my ex boyfriend made up when he was in 7th grade i have tought it to a lot of people here and everybody loves to say it it makes me so happy when i hear my new ut friends say it because it reminds me of the good things about home and it reminds me of matt too so , i love to hear a good ole' bont every once in a while the girls next door are really loud sometimes and i do not think that they like me they have been really bitchy so far and that bums me out because i like to get along with everybody there is this guy a few doors down from me and he 's really cool we like the same music and movies and all that good stuff he 's kind of crazy though but i like crazy sometimes are not we all a little crazy but he 's not that attractive , he 's kind of a big guy but , i have seen pictures of him when he was in high school and he was really cute it bothers me that this bothers me i'm not the type of person who judges others , especially by the way they look it 's not even like i'm judging him i just think that we get along really well but i would probably never date him and it bothers me to think that i'm that vain but i'm really just rambling and none of this makes sense very much i know how i'm feeling , but when i try to write it , it does not come out right oh well at least i know what i feel or at least , i think i know
2004_299.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i hate walking all over the place at this school my calves are going to double in size and they already do not fit into boots when i jumped horses i had to buy custom made boots so that my calves could fit into them my mom has big calves too maybe it runs in the family i do not really now anything else about calves weird thing to talk about probably , but mine really hurt right now beacuse of all the walking it seems like everyplace i have to go is all the way across c ampus oh well walking will probably be good for me maybe with all the walking i could loose some weight and make my ex boyfriend wish that he did not break up with me maybe i will dye my hair red too he would like that ha ha ha i think my hair would look good red i think i should dye it but i hear a lot of people say do not do it i think i should sonce i'm so pale i would like to have some depth i feel like my blonde hair washes me out i feel like i'm hemmingway short choppy sentences merely stating what 's going on around him his short choppy sentences had deep meaning though i wonder if my sentences have any deep meaning probably not since i have been talking about calves and hair so it goes i think about a lot of things sometimes i think so much that i ca not fall asleep at night when that happens i spray some stuff that smell like lavender on my pillows and fall right asleep lavender smells so good i also like that color it might be my favorite i do not know because i like really deep eggplant yeah eggplant it pretty , not a very good looking vegetalbe however good color bad vegetable they do not taste very good either i do not like many vegetables i like good that makes you fat it just tastes better my mom always yells at me when i eat fatting food sometimes when i just eat i get look i miss my mom i miss my car i wish i could go get in my car and blare the stereo and smoke that would be great it really gets all the stress out i love doing that i miss my car i also miss my cats , my friends , my ex when i see happy couples i want to throw rocks at them i do not but it frustrates me when i see how happy i used to be with another person , but in someone else then i start to think of him and i get sad oh good this is almost over this was harder than i thought trying to type really slows down your thinking but perhaps i am just a slow typer i probably should have learned how to properly type when i was a kid i just did not think it was important then they should have a service like maids who come to your house and type stuff for you another thing i wish i would have done is learn to play an instrament there is something so refined about a woman who can play an instrament there is also something very attractive about a guy who can play something , guitar , piano and whatnot very cool maybe beacuse they seem more sensative that is very important oh good 30 seconds yeah ! ! i have so much more to do tonight

2004_308.txt 0 0 1 1 1 i need to get out more i work all the time and go to school , and leaves so little time forme both of my parents a sick and living at home was kind of already planed it makes you a stronger person to get stuck doing the stuff i do , but i wonder what it would be like to be normal what it would be like to be selfish or not even selfish , but to not have so many people relie on me i want to meet boys and just hang out , but i'm so shy i think i look ok , but is ok enough i'm 22 years old and one guy has approched me with saying something to make me mad a lot of my frinds insted of being happy for me are so negative we are no dating , i have never been on a date , so should be single for ever i miss steven , but should i he 's been sent overseas probably to fight i only knew him for a few days and then he got his orders to leave he gave me his phone number , but i ca not call him
2004_309.txt 1 0 1 1 0 well , this is interesting let 's see right now , i feel like i'm not even doing homework , really sarika , mary and natasha are quizzing each other on medical terminology , which seems so much more studious than what i'm doing but i do not mind let 's see my hands have been smelling kind of funny like rust , almost but i have not touched anything rusty except , i did clean the shower today , and maybe the combination of ammonia and old residue causes such a smell , even when you are using gloves other than that , i do not really smell anything god , my stomach is rumbling like crazy now i really want to eat i'm so mad at myself , if i had just gone to that freshman business meeting , i would be eating free pizza now but no , i have to be a conformist and go when all my other friends are going now i have to pay for my food and even now , i will probably end up waiting until the other three girls in the room are done studying why am i such a follower i hope i gain some leadership qualities through my college experience i wonder why the microfridge makes that noise , that constant hum did you know , something 's wrong with the microfridge in my room we had it set at level 5 , and we open the door , and find that our water bottles have ice in them rather than water , and there are pearly crystals in our milk man , that was weird i lowered the temperature a little , hopefully that helps the strange thing is , our suitemates had their microfridge set at a little past level 5 , and their food is fine are not all the microfridges supposed to be the same fridge discrimination anyway what else is there to say my eyes feel sleepy not in the heavy sense though , where you feel as though you could not keep your lids up if your life depended on it no , not that kind of sleepy it 's the kind where your eyes slightly burn when you close them , and you have mild sinus symptoms or perhaps this feeling is due more to an oncoming sinus attack rather than my sleepiness either way , i should be sleepy , i did a lot of work today i'm so proud of my productivity today after calculus , i went straight to the library , printed out my ubc application , then went straight to one of the desks and did my psychology homework that 's right , two and a half hours of reading and taking notes i even drew a rudimentary picture of a neuron whoa sometimes i think i work too hard i mean , did i really have to write down all the processes of the neurons ultimately , i probably wo not need half the stuff i have taken note of luckily , i actually kind of enjoy psychology , so i do not mind taking the notes man , i need to spit out this gum it 's like i'm chewing rubber or something and my jaw hurts from all the exercise it 's gotten i think i have had this gum in my mouth for about two hours , if not more man , i have to laugh at the way these girls are studying they are thinking of ways to remember all the terminology here 's the funniest one penia means abnormal reduction so , what does my gutter mind think of hahaha i ca not help it , i'm still immature hopefully my professors do not get wind of it but you must admit , that 's a good way to remember penia , is not it i'm not even in medical terminology , and i will always remember that term oh god , my eyes are starting to feel a little heavy now , in addition to the burning why do i get so tired here true , i can probably sleep at any time , but i have noticed my desire to get to my bed as increased dramatically ever since i started school at ut maybe it 's the so called stress we just discussed in class today i was feeling pretty fit last week , maybe now i will get sick during labor day weekend let 's see six more minutes sorry , but i am counting down who knew twenty minutes was so interminably long i like using big words , it makes me feel so intelligent i know that 's immature to think , but i really am just a child inside , filled with all the normal childish feelings of wonder and happiness and petty jealousy yes , petty jealousy like my jealousy toward all the pretty girls on campus , many of whom are my friends , which makes me feel all the worse , because are not you supposed to not have bad feelings about your friends but i suppose that would not be human but guilt is a totally human feeling as well , so i will continue feeling that sometimes i wish i was my puppy , ginger , with my biggest worry being that i will see my own reflection on a window did you know that dogs sleep about 18 hours every day i would kill for such a luxury even when i'm retired , i doubt i will receive such a luxury i can feel the keys of the laptop getting warm or perhaps they were already warm who knows i definitely do not sorry , but seeing as how i only have about two minutes left , what will follow will probably be nonsensical gibberish that i'm typing for the sole purpose of taking up time i need to go to sleep but no , it 's only six in the evening six ! it 's like time moves at a slow warped speed here is not it supposed to be bedtime i want to sleep i want to sleep i want to sleep and dream i wish i could remember my dreams better , or that someone could analyze my dreams or maybe i do not want that who knows what would turn up
2004_311.txt 0 0 0 0 1 good morning eventhough it 's 12 30pm that is still morning in college hours they say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age , but i feel ten is a little more at par i'm trying to wake up so the music of the late elliott smith , a quiet honest indie rock musician but my roommates wo not turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they are listening to it 's kind of frusterating but after it 's all dried up , i do not think i could have got better roommates i love sitting at my laptop when i wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying it 's absurd really so monday night i found out from some of my friends in college station that my girlfriend , or x girlfriend , has already been cheating on me there damn aggies ca not live with them , ca not kill them it 's a cruel world but i will be better off without her i think i talk to my brother about the experience , the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart where everythought of the person , especially with someone else , makes you want to vomit but you still want to kiss them , even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face but i suppose it 's like morgan freeman says in the movie seven , love costs , it takes effort that 's true back to my brother , he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves he told me the trick is to realize that you are better off , in most cases for instance alyssa , my x , was beautiful no doubt god she was gorgeous , which always made me wonder what she saw in a low down dead beat like your author but she has no conscious knowledge of art ignorance is not the problem , she just does not care about things beyond looks , impression and money and well obviously she does not know what love really is but then again maybe i do not either but i know i loved her , i believed her lies i bought the false love she was selling for cheap i still love her i suppose , i ca not deny it but she loved herself , before she loved me and now i have to do the same i have to be strong and let time heal all another thing my brother said was how she did not have that one thing like i was talking about her lack of care for art , and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life she had beauty , she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile , but she lacked that one thing and i quote ben harper , so many people to love in my life , why do i worry about one i know there are better people out there so and i have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever i honestly felt bad after i chewed her out and she was crying try and figure that one out i suppose i'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last but i do not believe that saying nice guys do not finish last , they just get shit on until they get the best in the end i believe that if you hold out , if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer , you will find them i'm glad i do not have class today , makes it much easier to relax , despite the fact how much i enjoy college compared to high school high school , what a joke you are not pushed , you are not inspired in high school , you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd to conform and be normal i always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country but then again i am just one person so i try to go out there , find small things to make me happy , if only temporarily to just get by i guess that 's my motive for life , for living happily and in peace i try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions i think sometimes it 's good to be apathetic and passive , and other times it is not for instance , your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car just relax and roll down the windows and cruise but if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette , that is unacceptable it 's sad when people do not care important issues i guess i just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues , when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol , and too little about the major issues , war , politics , etc i think life is a crazy thing a conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action i think that maybe one day , i will have all the answer , and then i will die maybe one day i will find a love that is true maybe maybe i think too much
2004_312.txt 1 0 1 1 0 i am sitting in my room there is tile being laid in the bathroom next to me the sound of musics floats in from the next room paint smells intoxicate me i feel slightly light headed as i have for the past several days in my apartment the sound of the modem next to the computer begins to hum as if it is heating up my mama walks in the room and looks annoyed as the desk she trying to put together is not working according to her plan i wonder whey she looks so upset about it the air conditioner begins to run i have a book for my government class lying open on the floor who would have known that there would be that much reading for one class i cannot tell if i want to finish reading it or try and take notes from class for it to make sense the phone rings next to me i do not pick it up because i am worried i have waited too long to finish this assignment and i wo not get full credit i fell asleep reading earlier this afternoon and just woke up funny how the time just slips away like that you are payiong attention to everything around you one minute and the next it is gone you wake up and ca not remember when you fell asleep the time before right now my nose starts to itch which is funny , because it is not even dusty in my apartment right now the green wall of my bedroom is making the setting sunlight a strange color on my feet they look a weird yellow color as if they are becoming infected with something it makes my sheets look pretty though the mixture of green , yellow , and purple reminds me of a rainbow everything is starting to fade my mind and eyes start to slow down everyone around me is moving too fast for my taste i want it to slow down everything should be slower these days i like it when it is lazy like on sundays i watch tv until i feel like eating something i can smell my mama start to cook dinner she always makes such good food for me i smell cheese melting on something i think it might be broccoli but you ca not smell brocolli i keep spelling that differently i wonder how it is supposed to be spelled how funny things like that when they happen like when you ca not remember how to spell and or something easy like that i realized i have not typed for the whole 20 minutes right now , but i have to have it in by five i think i will try to do it again in a minute i hope this is not too bad
2004_314.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i guess i will talk about the guy i was dating before i came here , since i just got off the phone with him before i got on the computer to complete this assignment after dating him for two months i realized relationships differ greatly from person to person there are no straight rules to follow everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them at first i was so confused by this guy because he did not call me on a regular bases or he did not schedule dates like other guys did after just talking to him now has made me realized he did not do this to be a jerk but it is who he is , because he only called me when he had something to say to me right now he is dating another girl but he does not call her and she does not call him i think that is weird i guess i will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them i still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but i am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact i had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work i was thinking i could never do that i think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact because i believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship , so that is why the guy and i are not together i thinki'm still new to the dating thing because i do not understand it i try not to play games , but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is i have mostly dated older people my first real boyfriend was seven years older than i that relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than i was his majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy , that was why it lasted as long as it did i think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there wo not be somebody else in the future to fill that person 's spot after breaking up with him i felt i needed a boyfriend and i even felt a little lonely now i am fine and mostly dated for fun i guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid i gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others i find attractive or of high standing and what i do not want my future husband to have one day not to say i am definitly marrying someone but i hope i will find that right someone for right now though i am going to stick to being a loner because being so close to someone can be distracting and my purpose here is to stay focused on school becuase before i ever get married i want to have finished school for my own personal goal you ca not always rely on others in life so if i get a good education i can get a good job to support myself this has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and do not stop what you are doing just for someone else because that someone else might not always be there this has led me to conclude that you should not care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it does not harm anyone else i hope i fulfilled the assignment by writing aobut what i was thinking about i feel confused by relationships and i guess i should be and i am assuming that everyone else is confused by them as well i just hope everything will work in the long run and so i will try not to worry about because i used to worry about things to much that i would stress my self out
2004_315.txt 0 1 0 0 1 it seems like everyone has gone home for labor day weekend lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good we had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes i really do not normally like mashed potatoes but i always just get them anyway a couple people started playing coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class the more you think about it , the more unflowing the paper will be this dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us at night , we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance they tend to yell and be extremely loud our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow it would have been done today , but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off there are so many more months before the semester is over ! i'm sure it will go quickly though twenty minutes seems like a long time right now i still have to go to wal mart today because we are completely out of snacks in the room i'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me our cafeteria only serves tea , water , coffee , and punch i have been watching way too much of the real world in the past two days they have been playing reruns nonstop since like wednesday this week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because monday and wednesday are my busy days i want to get out of the city next weekend maybe i will go visit some friends at texas state or go to the lake i have not been swimming in really long time i remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than i remember swimming in my own pool maybe because it was more exciting since my family did not have one at the time our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make the trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but i never once got stung the lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that 's ok because nothing can spill out well maybe twenty minutes is not a long time because i'm over half way done the game on saturday was really fun once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable unt did not do very well i almost went there instead of ut just because its close to home and my sisters went there on the other hand , it was maybe a little too close to home i do not know why i bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when i have a computer sitting right in front of me its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book i hear a lawnmower outside i feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on labor day my neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long i should trim my fingernails they keep getting in the way while i'm typing i have not seem a movie since i came to austin i do not even know where a movie theater is around here better yet , i do not know what is playing right now i have not seen any previews either someone must be sick because i keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway people go out way too much i ca not go out on a school night without feeling badly i always want to wait for the weekend i'm sure that will change shortly though this has been a very long weekend i think i'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow

2004_317.txt 0 1 0 0 0 so this is the first entry , and it happens to fall on a day when things are really shitty i do not know if i have the desire to join the rowing team , though i have already told everyone that i was going to my internet connection was messing with my earlier , a reason to cry in itself my relationship with a boy i do not know enough about lets start with that i have been dating him for about a year and a half , and i do not know who he is will he cheat on me is my relationship anything to be worried about if a stranger looked into our lives , would he giggle , surprised at the immaturity of our relationship is it anything to try to save i hope so , if not i'm a fool but i think i'm one anyway but paul henry , he knows his shit , it seems or its that he knows that he does not know his shit i wish i knew i wish i knew him as well though his devotion is something that would automatically clash with me i have nothing against christians or their beliefs i wish i could give myself up to that with no regrets but i ca not i have been down that road , and its lead nowhere have i spoiled my chances with a true love by being with brian will i ever be content in my own two damn shoes will i ever feel like i'm at home will i be successful would i be happy without success it seems like the lives people live are all too perfect , even the less desireable , that there 's some author out there , other than someones god , writing the stories of our lives but he forgot me why am i not going anywhere , why ca not i find this happiness and joy my life is pathetic at this point maybe its just this horrible attitude , but the only time i feel like i can be happy ( or at least not pissed off ) is with brian , laying in his bed , thinking of everything and nothing all at the same time but how does this conflict so much with the previous statements it would seem that i am happy with him , but then comes the doubt and fears i need to find myself , i say only thing is i do not know what that means does anyone its really this unattainable goal people teasing set in your minds a state you need to obtain , but its in fact unattainable the sad bastards who were told the same thing when they were younger are enraged that they do not know how to go about it , and they then ruin the lives of everyone after them , so they can suffer justly i wish i were born in the old days , when you died of a flu and there was not such a thing as aids people lived lightly , they wrote , they read , sometimes found something to revolutionize , but mostly enjoyed the simplicity of life where did that virtue go how has it managed to slip through the fingers of time , and where would it have gone i wish i could sift through the ashes of our charred world , seeking only the beauty and peace that once was everywhere , but now seems like you have to search for only to get the smallest glimpse of it how come i ca not be a writer how come i ca not write i want to study people , not medicine why would i declare this major if i studied other peoples lives all the time , would i have a life of my own is true adulthood worth it people always want what they ca not get i get what i do not want everything always seems like it gets really good , i mean reaaaally good , right when its about to end will college be like this will life itself be like this will i stop asking so many damn questions will he call would i want him to i do not want this life anyone want to trade i want a life of the storybooks , of unquestionable love , faith and virtue knowledge , hope , and an impeccable body would be nice too i want all the money in the world , i want to live in a time without money i want to be a movie critic , i hate bad actresses with hair that does not fit their character i hate living with someone other than who i love i hate not knowing if its really the true love they talk about i hate being inadequate , i hate second guessing everyone i hate being critical i hate chocolate chips i hate gaining weight i hate stretchy jeans that do not look good i hate running out of time , i hate trying to fill time i hope this class makes me realize a few things about myself , although i'm not sure why it would seven six five four three two one
2004_318.txt 1 0 0 0 0 i love my girlfriend leah she is so awesome i love her big butt and her hair , i love her tongue and her smile man oh man does she give good hand jobs almost as good as sex almost there are some things i do not like about her though she is a tiny bit chubby but it does not really bother me that much she is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves i also worry that she is a shopaholic and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income i wonder what i will be doing 5 years from now it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj i think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time i believe that would be best , cause then i could stay up late still and sleep in a little later the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too i would have fun being the dj in the morning , but i would hate the hours i mean whoa , not my kind of lifestyle i also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out i have not been really an active gym goer i need to start doing that i am trying to think of what would be a good time to go on mondays i could go right after class at 5 , same thing goes for wednesdays on tuesdays , thursdays and fridays , i should probably go right after spanish , because then after i am done i could go eat something , that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that i would not have to eat before i go to spanish then i could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday , wednesday and friday and then weight train on tuesday and thursday maybe i should do the opposite cause then i could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out , plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time now about tennis i really hope i can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice i should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things i need to do it would be cool if leah and sara came to ut next year , unfortunetly i do not see that happening when it comes to leah i wonder how long i should wait before proposing i think waiting til at least my junior year would be best because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship i mean two years is a long time to be with someone , and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together no wait they were actually 3 5 years i think , maybe 2 5 when he asked and 3 5 before marriage , i do not know , whatever it is the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money i could probably go back to heb cause i mean they do not pay that poorly possibly even be a ccm or something so that i could bring a little extra dough in i would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station i wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show i should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if i could get some kind of spot in there even if it was not a show , but a technical thing okay so when it comes to homework what should i do so that i have somewhat of a schedule if i sleep in the mornings , or at least plan to , i do not think i should try scheduling that in what i should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure i get hw done first before i do anything else because then i could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job would not be too bad cause that 's probably my problem , the fact that i do not go to sleep early enough i want to go to midnight rodeo this saturday , i just wish roger creager was not playing there remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later back to study monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all i have is my writing class easy , and spanish , so getting out late on those days is not too bad tuesdays and thursdays i should try to make sure i am done with hw by like 6 , cause then i could go eat after i did my hw that 's a pretty good plan only on occasions should i change that up what i mean by that is like being invited to do stuff , never let it be online poker or tv that distracts me , that includes playing xbox even if i think i have had a hard day so far , just think how more satisfying that resting will be once i have everything done , i mean knowing u do not have anything left to do is a nice feeling this writing this is going by faster than i thought i did not know i had all this stuff on my mind i think it would be nice to have a 6pac on my body , and some muscle you know , it really does kind of upset me that leah does not want me hanging out with females alone i find that it should not matter i mean on one hand i know her past , and i do not want to upset her on something as small as this , but on the other hand it is kind of a big deal maybe i should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this hopefully we can compromise i am kind of tired but i really do need to study for spanish quizzes tomorrow , and i should look over chapter 4 for this class i wonder when the first test is , i think it is on the 20th that 's coming up pretty soon i should look at that handbook thing i have on sample test questions on this friday along with that i could reread philosophy

2004_322.txt 1 0 0 0 1 oh man i'm so hungry i ca not wait for the football game tonight , it 's going to be lots of fun wow , i think really fast , cause i'm so thinking about 3 things at once hunger , football , and the giant pre screening survey thing that i just took can you believe that i finished it at 2 54 , only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them man talking about some pressure speaking of pressure , i just thought of physics , which is kind of weird since i do not have physics this year i do have math though i played cards last time i was in class we played this crazy russian game it was really cool we tied in the end wow , ok , so now that i typed , i thought of anime and forums since i use that on forums all the time , and it 's an anime face and now i'm thinking about how i can type without looking at the keyboard i just moved the mouse , and that reminded me of a real mouse man , i make a lot of typos of well , did you know that i learned to type too early that i lifted my hands off the keyboard so i could type faster since , i had small hands and so in i think 10th grade i had to fix myself , and retaught myself 10 finger typing cause you see this hover hands typing caused me to look at the keyboard the song just changed and it totaly distracted me speaking on song , i met a girl named helen song , the first day of psycology and she 's really cool i like her a lot as a friend but at the same time i want to ask her out but you know that my biggest fear ( and pretty much the only one ) is losing a friend and so i have trouble asking girls out cause i'm afraid after they say no , that they do not want to be friends anymore why am i telling you this oh well , for all i know you do not read these , or you read them completely hehe , you know why do some people type hehe , and other haha you told us to think about our reactions and our observations i bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking , pay more attention to their random observation thoughts i bet that produces a lot of weird data me , well i ask a lot of questions , and think really fast i often find myself daydreaming all the time ! hehe so yeah , wow , hehe sounds like a girl to me not to self , refrain from saying hehe i glanced at the clock for the first time i wonder is that means that i'm finally bored after 8 30 minutes but as i keep typing , huh , i thinking more about the actual act of typing i just looked at the title , stream of consciousness of writing but now the music changed to a good song so i'm distracted from that last thought this song is good it 's techno i know that i listed to it cause it matches my lifestyle , fastpassed wow , i ca not spell so yeah , my sat score was 580 reading and 780 math that 's just a little weighed do not you think there it is again i just though of the entire universe and big guns , and planets and spaceships , this is going by way faster than i can type , but trust me that i'm having a ball here soccer , now that i have not played in a while , and i just started playing tennis that was tiring , but i want to work to be the best starcraft , and my daydream story just came into my mind you see in order to pass the time i come up with a story and slowly play it out in my head with extreme detail a single day dream could take up to month to complete , as i start and stop it when neccissary man , i'm getting excited about football you know i have never seen a whole football game before i'm sweating , maybe i should go turn down the ac , neh , that 's my mom 's domain , and well i do not want to stop typing what only 6 minutes left , well i suppose that means 75 of the time has passed i wonder why i converted this into a percentage that 's really weird you know talk , that 's what my phone said , cause it did not ring , huh , strange , why would i type that i think that means i'm focussing too much on typing and not enough on other events , although i suppose it really does not matter does it but as i progress i think more and more about my typing so do you know javascript , did you create that timer , or did you 's teal' the code for it , and use it on you site i had not noticed this song was annoying till now i normally listen to music when on my computer , you know like browsing the web , or photoshoping ( digital image creation ) the only times i do not have it on is when i watch anime , or play a game speaking of anime , i just finished watching wow ok like 5 titles flashed through my head hellsing , that was the last one i watched you know i like anime much better than tv cause they can create a long drawn out plot which is infinitly better than a single 30 minute plot it 's like watching a book rather than reading one reading , the last thing i read was a starcraft book , yeah it came from the game that 's sad i know , but i just could not focus on lord of the rings you know i wonder how much other people type , i mean , am i a fast typer the amount they turn in has to be due to the typing speed and not the thought speed let me tell you , cause we think incredibly fast
2004_323.txt 0 1 0 0 0 well , yesterday was a good day , that is until i spoke to my boyfriend on the phone i guess i was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing i was mad at him and then hung up with him , then i called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him it was just one big drama over nothing i guess i made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really did not mean that ofcourse made me sad , because all i wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him he is attending college at texas state , the big party school , and i guess i'm just scared i'm going to lose him he 's already been doing what that school is known for , boozing it up although i have not been with him for long , the connection we share is the best feeling i have felt in such a long time it makes me sad because i'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last i have never heard anything good about long distance relationships , and the more i think about it , the more i worry maybe that 's why i was being rude to him my fears just come out in other ways it 's so strange though because i know i can see him pretty much every weekend i'm just so confused right now maybe i'm just stressed it is my first year of college and i'm expreiencing so many new things , including confusing lectures from professors i just want everything to be okay i want good grades i want to have fun and most of all i want to work things out with my boyfriend i felt like crying when i got off the phone with him last night , but i held back because i did not want my room mate to thing anything was wrong when i think of my boyfriend i can only think of a future with him i have known him a lot longer than i have actually been with him , and it 's not that he 's just someone to kiss and hug , he 's more of a best friend to me i know this may not last forever , and that 's what makes my heart break i'm only 18 what are the odds of he and i actually getting married , honestly then it makes me think why i even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end there really is no point on the other hand , i need to be with this boy life just would not be the same without him what to do maybe i will just propose to him haha , yeah right i just want things to be okay i just want to be happy , and it seems he 's one of the main reasons i am grrr , all of this stuff does not even make any sense anyhow , this writing assignment was really helpful got some of my feelings out , and i have never said any of this stuff to anyone it was like a journal i'm glad i'm taking such a cool class
2004_324.txt 1 1 0 0 1 autumn will be here soon i wake up , get myself together , look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city down down the elivator once again , floor 13 , now floor 1 i step ouside and inhale , a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs this is where i realsize that everyday is but a breath that single inhale was a day , was a life old postcards line my smile i am a story , and i tear up when i thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences my eyes desperately search for ideas , while i know they are all within some governing organ i possess heart or head , it does not matter but i find it odd that my eyes do the searching my little fan is growling at me it 's probably upset that i always leave it on let me turn it off really quick ok done i heard a door shut the people in my dorm are an infestation i cannot stand them i try so hard to see the good within everyone , but how can i if they are all the same everyday i walk around the autumn grasping campus and i look look at people , the sky , the earth , the buildings but the people i look at the people they make me laugh ! we are so strange i see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an ipod pumping sound into their skulls people who try to look sexy people who look mad at the world , and sneer at you , the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance people look at me too what is it that i possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine my heart races when they do that it 's kind of a love i love them for that one milisecond i understand them for one lapse of time but did they look at me because i was looking toward them am i attractive to them am i mysterious scary sexy sometimes people look at me that 's my job i absolutely hate being in here trapped between machine and the cement walls around me i cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media i do not watch tv , i do not keep up with any news , i listen to music and read books entertainment is all i need on media terms we should kill our tv 's though as one of my favorite bands says i wish the world was flat like the old days i have to say amen we need to evolve backwards ! we need to get back to the old way of life , religion , and appreciate the earth and sky , appreciate our unique existence in the universe we need to notice our equality before we notice the differences but , i suppose it 's just wishfull thinking
2004_327.txt 1 1 0 1 1 i'm thinking about if i am going to get the job that i want at the pac at the university it would suck if i did not i am proud that the otc called me for a job interview , they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like i did not waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so i ca not type as fast and i keep having to go back and erase but i like pressure i thrive under it but i do not like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words i do not like those because i am so used to using slang that i just do not type it anymore and i also hate having to capitalize my i 's it makes me mad having to go back right now i feel a little stress because i am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday i had a meeting and i did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all i could read was biology which is another class i do not understand i never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either i feel lost in that class it is so difficult i feel like i dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not i just keep thinking about what prof pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel like screaming i guess but the professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home i had a divided keyboard the flowy ones and now i have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment i like but i feel like i should not say anything incriminating and there go the stupid i 's and i forgort to put and apostrophe in should not and the i messed me up again well forget it no more caps the i 's are going to be in lower case sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit i need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend i get to go home though i want to go to the game i have not boguht the sports package and i did not feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot i guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy 's a football player so i feel like i should go for him but i'm not going now i get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe i will get sick when i go home like prof pennebaker said probably because i feel the migrane coming i hate migranes i hate having to find a job hopefully i get a good one i have an interview on tuesday i hope it goes well and that i make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood i wonder how the bus works i keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause i have seen it once after running to the engineering building because i was late i saw the bus and i think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but i will take a look around and see if that 's how it works now i feel like i have run out of things to say i still have to do the experiment for this class i want to do the survey but since i am under 18 i have to get my moms signature and i feel like i should be happy about going home i mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like huh and i hope nothings happens like the bus does not break down or like it is kidnapped' i know i worry too much but i do not want anything to happen even if it means that i have to do all the homework , i have been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys , and what was i talking about i do not kno , i need to make friends me and my roommate get along but i need other friends and now i have 5 minutes left , what to write about anyways back to the making friends i saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart asian in the elevator today i feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that i have are okay but i do not really relate to them why i do not kno i feel like they exclude me too much and they do not at least i hope they do not and if they do i do not well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still i have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really i am surprised i wrote this much i thought i was going to run out of this to say but i like this assignment when prof pennebaker said it i was like yes no grammar rules i do not particularly like grammar but i try i mean i suck at it in my papers i always score low on it 2 minutes and i have mentioned my time too many times i tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and i did nto so now i keep talking about not because i want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts i think it is the flourescent lighting i think that is how u spell that and i just put the letter u for the word you and i am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and i keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh i thought it was over but i am going to stop now because a i do not want to talk for too long and i have to go turn of this light and i am thinking about what i just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if i should put my name at the bottom but i wo not because i have the code thing well this was productive and i did not put well in caps
2004_328.txt 0 1 0 0 1 well , i have to do this weird assignment for psychology i think its neat , but kind of weird that spoon full peanut butter was really good i'm going to have to have some more later the atkins diet is a bitch even though you can eat all the protein you want i still crave the bun on my buger i was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room god , i felt like such an idiot then i went crazy looking for my roommate sam cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and i could not find her and i do not have her number memorized i do not know i felt stupid i feel so fat ! ! ! ! even though i'm not overweight at all i just feel fat i have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time i thinks obsessive compulsive or something i feel like i always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place i guess i always feel like i have to impress everyone shut up sam , god she makes the most annoying sounds i have ever heard anyway yeah i just always feel fat i think i way around 123 and i'm 5 1 i just want be a little bit thinner maybe 5 or 7 pounds lighter well , i'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits , and i feel like i got to loose a few they are awesome , but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we have just grown to be the best of friends i'm only 18 , and its weird cause one of them is 42 and the other is 30 i'm so excited cause i miss them a lot i think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 6 hours to come and visit when i went down a couple of weeks ago back home , they took me out to south padre island and we all got wasted i like it cause i can trust them and more importantly they can trust me i have a little head ache right now i wonder if it was the peanut butter i hope not i'm really thirsty all i have been drinking is water cause of that diet i just started it yesterday and i probably wo not see any results till maybe in a few more days i miss isaiah i love him so much , but he 's about 6 hours away and a senior in high school i love him but the last time i went down i did not feel the same love for him like i used to maybe i'm just in love with the image of him i guess that can happen i have been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person i am i wanted to come to ut because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you well , i still do not know who i am i know that i'm sweet , kind , and talented , but there 's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that i do not get into trouble maybe everyone does that i guess i will never know i 'm really glad that i have a good roommate we are exactly alike and we get along really well i just miss everyone from back home , but i know when pam and kristy come to visit me i will feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and i m so in love with her music i recently went to a sarah mclachlan concert on july 23 this summer now that was probably the best experience of my life it was awesome their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches , i think that 's how you spell it i 'm really excited to meet her cause she 's hilarious i spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and i have not met her in person yet , but i'm looking foward to it cause she said she likes having a good time and i'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together i can't wait ! ! ! ! 1 i'm tired now i have not gotten any sleep since i'v been here , wow the times almost running out , ,
2004_329.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i'm already starting to feel stressed out , and i have not had any tests yet it 's only been two weeks of school so far , and i feel like i have so much to do i guess it 's typical for for an incoming freshman , since it 's new and all i have never felt so busy in my life watching tv , my old passion , seems like such a waste of time to me now if i have spare time , i could actually be checking out austin , like the duck boat , which our ra told us about it seems so cool ! ! a tour bus turning into a boat it 's craziness , and a little scary we supposedly may go as a hall , which i highly doubt because we do not seem to have hall unity or whatever i guess i had a misconception of how dorm life would be at this point , i think getting an apartment would have been just fine , other than the fact that i'm way closer to my classes living on campus ok so maybe dorms are not so bad because i do not think i want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco i really need to figure out the bus routes because i do not know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west , which i accidentally got on to during orientation it was a great detour wow , 20 minutes is a long time , i just realized that i guess i was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else , it seemed like nothing so yea , back to the stressed out business i have had something to do since the beginning of summer , since i took summer 1 at a community college , then i went to clinton , oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister in law out with the hotel they own there i worked and got paid good stuff a few days after i got home from clinton , i made my way to austin my new home in the kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics and i think we all know how busy things are around here i thought christmas break would be relaxing and chill time , but i was mistaken for i found out my closest cousin is getting married january 15 , the weekend before classes start this means that for christmas break , i will be helping out with the wedding , which from experience already i know is very stressful and my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding , which is an indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance so now i have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so i can perform it in front of hundreds of people did i mention that i am a nervous person who freaks out easily oh and by the way , the wedding is in new mexico , and the reception is in houston a weekend later , so i have to go back home after a week of being in austin , followed by who knows how long of being in albuquerque , new mexico my home is in lufkin , a little town of pop 35 , 000 in east texas , just two hours north of houston , 3 hours south of dallas , and four hours east of austin man oh man , this is going to be a hectic year and to think i thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry well maybe i will grow from all these things , in stead of losing my mind i guess we will see hey , that kind of relates to psychology huh maybe i can be a case study , which i read about in the textbook
2004_330.txt 1 1 1 1 1 when i think about what i'm thinking , a void pops up i guess because the brain never really stops , it 's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment i can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however , so that 's what i will dicuss a topic that 's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend ( surprising right ) i think about how happy i am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is he goes to college at trinity university , which is in my hometown of san antonio we see eachother nearly every weekend , so it 's not hard to sustain the relationship though , i constantly wonder if he really does care about me he tells me that he does , and i know that he does , but i'm really insecure about that issue my insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me , but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal that 's probably why i worry so much about it however , i am really happy in my relationship i have no complaints except for my own lack of security on another topic , i have my first test this thursday i'm a little scared , but i think that i will be fine i pretty much know the material , but i still need to go over and over it to get it down i do not think i will have a problem with it at least i hope that i do well i feel exahsted thinking about all the studying i have to do for my upcoming tests i have a chemistry test next week i do not know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is but i guess that i'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so i do well it 's so imperitive that i do well in college because i have plans to go to medical school after i graduate i do not know what else i would do with my life if i did not get into medical school i have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen i could be a teacher if medical school does not work out the pay is not that great but the job seems pretty alright i would enjoy some sort of fbi cia type of work also i need something that 's going to make me constantly think though i hate studying , as every student does , keeping my mind on the go is something i love i think that 's why i played soccer all my life soccer is a game of constant thinking there is no stopping in soccer there are no time outs , so you ca not stop to regroup you have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player i wish i was still playing soccer i really miss it i stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back i feel sort of empty without it it was such a big part of my life for so long i think i'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the ut soccer team it 's really hard to do that though the team is extremely competative though , i think after i talk to my coaches back home , maybe they can help my main concern at the moment is doing well in school i really need to buckle down and study i study everyday , but i need to do it more i think maybe i'm just stressing about my upcoming tests i'm scared about my chemistry test though , i think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material , that i will be fine i need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow the test is thursday , so i have 2 days to get in all the information i feel tired right now i wish i had came back to austin earlier so i would have started on my work earlier well , tomorrow 's another day , so i guess i will just do a lot of studying tomorrow there 's no sense in doing it right this second when i'm not feeling to good and when i'm tired my main priority is studying for my biology test thursday i need to go over the old exam she gave to us my boyfriend just called me , but i had to tell him that i would call him back so i could finish this writing assignment i really hope i do well on my test thursday if i did well , i would be so happy that would mean that i actually liked my major and that i could retain the information pertaining to it i want to call my boyfriend back after this , but my roommate ca not consontrait with my talking , so i guess i will go outside though , she 's talked many a times with her boyfriend while i was reading oh well , maybe i'm a little more respectful
2004_333.txt 1 1 1 0 1 so , i can now finally begin this writing i am pretty relaxed right now because i have a wonderful boyfriend he is funny , sweet , and weird like i am i feel like i am writing in a journal trying to track my thoughts is weird because i feel like i jump from one idea to the next really quickly it is almost as if i am add in the mind that sounds weird i keep hearing this ticking from this tiny pink watch that is sitting right next to me it surprises me how loud it ticks for being a wrist watch now , i can hear the television from the living room it sounds pretty interesting i can hear the air condition vent outside the apartment complex the air just turned off now but the vent is as loud as can be i like the noise of the keyboard when i type especially when i type fast the clicks make me think that i am really accomplishing something i am going to stop talking about sounds now and try to see what my mind is does write now i am a little tired my brain seems a little slow right now i feel a little overwhelmed by the school work load along with my sorority obligations and my job i am happy thinking about my sorority i love the girls ! everyone of them make me feel important ant that i really matter all the girls are so fun to be around too we all love to go out to parties and dance man , that car outside that just passed through was very loud the music was rap and not very good i do not understand sometimes why people ride around at night with really loud music and their windows down for everyone to hear it seems kind of dumb to me that it is a week day night and there are people out there thinking they are all cool man this watch ticking is really bothering me it 's amazing how many things i hear when i really think about things this means i am not talking which is a really good accomplishment for me i love to be social and visit with everyone i just remembered that i am missing music normally , when i type or do any homework i like to listen to some music when i do math , i can listen to any kind of music i want but if i have a paper or any readings , i can only listen to classical music speaking of music , i had my first t a session for my history of rock class it was really interesting the teacher is pretty cool and nice we get to listen to all kinds of music every class the only thing is it seemed to me like i was learning all about how music works again like as if i was in band all over again man , i keep looking at the clock and just realized that my twenty minutes is almost up i remember looking at seven minutes thinking that this was going to be a long twenty minutes i was wrong i am almost done and it went by so fast my stomach does not feel too well i think i ate too much marshmallows also , my head hurts now maybe i just did not eat enough today i only have
2004_334.txt 1 0 0 0 1 stream of consciousness somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner 's a light in august we read that nnovel in my senior ap english class and although iit was a touch on the boring side at the beginning , it proved to be quite an interesting story well i'm in my dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times i e when i'm trying to take a nap our refrigerator is in the closet it was in the middle of the room , but my roommate moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead my roommate 's name is ricky and he 's been out of town this weekend as far as i can tell he kind of just did not come home on friday night so my assumption is that he 's visiting his family i think he 's from laredo , but i could be mistaken ricky is dating a girl named natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne because it smells like crap ! which sucks , because it 's a really expensive dolce and gabbana or however you spell it it really is terrible because it 's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to everything in our room especially all my clothes , which has made me start to smell like him oh i hate it i always want to say something , but it would be weird saying to him that his designer cologne smells like ass and that i could make the scent personally with some onions and curry god ! i have been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of weeks , but have not exactly found one well i found one on guadalupe , but have not looked at what the times are for mass or whatever my dad is really pushing me to start going to church because in the last few years he 's become somewhat of a jesus freak he 's not bad , but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things for instance , i joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it refuses to help pay for it simply because he does not like fraternities but he does not exactly say why and since he 's never been in one i do not see how he can make such a judgement oh well , my dad and i went camping this weekend we like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a place called reimer 's ranch so we found a new camp site called krause springs and it was really nice so we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever but me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that i took the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the ground it was pretty bad , but i made it through only got about 3 and a half hours of sleep though ughh oh well , when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed to reimer 's and it was closed ! so all that work for nothing but we did not give up hope and went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there , but only got to do one route because it started to rain so after that our hopes were pretty much shot so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and i took a nap that i just woke up from about 20 minutes ago so my weekend was pretty lackluster but it will be ok because i know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one oh well my mom just called me a second ago and i was like , can i call you right back i'm doing a project and she 's so understanding and just said bye really quick so after i'm done with this thingy i will call her back i have actually been keeping in touch with my mom pretty well since i moved here which has been nicer than i imagined it would i expected it to be annoying talking to her too much but i was mistaken i have also been talking to my sister via email which has been fun she 's so funny and always has something to say , but whenever i call home and she answers it 's like we have nothing to say and i just ask for mom kind of funny , but it 's cool i know it 's weird , but the thing i miss the most about home is my dog i have a full blooded springer spaniel named lola and she 's such an awesome dog i miss her so much , but i'm hoping that if i live in a frat house next year i can bring her along so we do not have to be apart anymore oh well , i guess we will see
2004_339.txt 0 0 1 1 0 ok well i'm thinking about how long of a day it was , i got to school kind of late and i was almost late to my first class i'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny i think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately , we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 35 i just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and i told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there was not any time to do it well she did not listen to me she said for me to call her at 7 15 if she hasnt called me she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester she was very moved by the way the professor was i think she said i wish i had him for my psy class i told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr daly who is a very cool teacher as well , his class is awesome he 's so charismatic , today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and i have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so , and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples , now on the topic of my girlfriends friends by the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and i love her a lot , i do not know when and where but someday we plan on getting married , i think we are different than most couples , i know that everybody probably says that but i really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and i hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve god in our relationship , not as much as we should but more than most couples i think , in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks but since we got up here , we have not read it at all , i think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night now back to her other friend named nancy well she is rooming with desiree 's old roommate kelly , and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy , she was really mad from what i hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt without some kind of notice , and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend is not over there as much as he should be like my roommate said that he was not going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here well now that she is up here too , he said that he was not going to talk to her at all , well shit that did not last very long , just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share hmm what a coincidence , i mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and i think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we did not see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class , i mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and i told him that i do not know because i running tight on money and i kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because i went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel the part that she got mad at was the jeans that i bought for 100 dollars and that 's because they were on sale she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that so i do not know if ill go but i do want to play him in ncaa 2005 college football that 's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that i have not even tried it i think i'm going right now to go play laterz !

it reminds me of my ex boyfriend that sucks because he has not been too nice to me here lately man i could talk all day about him doubt the reader of this crappy paper would really enjoy that , but that is now what i am thinking about so i guess get ready he is so cute he is so sweet besides lately he always could cheer me up , but we broke up right before i left because he is just now a senior in high school and he did not want to date when i was living 4 hours away i must say that is a long distance away from the person that you are dating , but i really do believe i love him he is so the person for me , and i do not know exactly how to take that i do not know if i should try to get over him or if i should just keep talking to him and trying to get him to come visit me or if i should even tell him that i love him i am so confused ! urgh ! i wish this program could talk back because i would be so happy to receive advice i thought it was so funny when my psychology teacher hold on i totally forgot what i was thinking about anyway someone puked in my living room the other night yea , it really pissed me off i wonder why they did not just go to the freakin' bathroom !

2004_345.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i am at a study hall room at the time wondering what i will think about that i am going to write there are people behind me talking and one went ole miss which makes me think of a friend of mine from high school who is a freshman there now i wonder how he is doing now along with all my other friends that is not attending ut there are actually several people going here from my high school but i only see about half of them on a regular basis i am a little stressed with all the things going on because i have done the thing that everyone has said not to but i think no matter what it happens to everyone it is just the thought of all the freedom and then all of a sudden a couple weeks go by and there are quizes , tests , and papers due at the same time i am also stressed about so many different things such as a typical college freshman is one guy said that his fine arts was theater and dance that made me think about when i was confused on what to take when i was signing up for classes people ask me what this is that i am typing because they can read exactly what i am thinking i am actually hungary with all these people talking about food is kind of a word not sure but it should be i just found a phone on the desk but completely forgot that it was mine until i opened it up i lost my phone a week ago so i do not have any of the numbers that i used to have , i hope this is not being graded for correct grammer because i am trying to type as fast as i think i have already been typing for 10 minutes already and am wondering what else i am going to talk about i also do not know what class i am going to drop , which haves to be done tomorrow i cannot take 16 hours that i am currently signed up for so i will drop one to drop down to 13 hours a friend of mine just called saying that he cannot make it to lunch a guy is just now sitting beside me and he is about to start eating something that makes me hungary again he is reading everything i type and just corrected me on a mistake i am running out of things to say or talk about i am thinking now about my place and hearing some stories in the background most people are done with their homework and are asking me questions about this assignment , i am actually kind of comfortable right now at the computer i do not have a computer yet at my apartment so it is really hard for me to get to an actual one to do assignments and get notes off the internet i have yet to figure out how many notes to take from class since everything is different in college i have a lot of stuff to do like go to walmart , the grocery store and other places to get caught up on everything only a few more minutes left until i am done with this i wonder again if this is for completion grade or even if it is going to be read i bet the counselors read all these to see if we are all okay since majority of the class is freshman wow , i cannot believe that the twenty minutes is almost up i'm going into a blank thought because of this pressure that the timer is putting on me for some reason what else should i say
2004_347.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i am finally taking a break from doing my math homework i am so excited to finally be doing nothing i am so excited that i finally got my laundry back because now i do not have to worry about it , but i do need to do a load of some personal items while looking around my room i see my side pretty neat and then i look at my roommate 's side and it is a pig sty it bothers me because she has buckets overflowing everywhere , when they could easily at least be hidden under her bed maybe we will have a talk about that later who knows but i cannot wait for this weekend because not only is it a three day weekend , but that 's one more day that i do not have to go to class i love living here at towers but the walls are paper thin i can hear anything and everything that my roommate suitmate say and sometimes that 's okay but when i'm trying to concentrate on something it kind of bothers me oh well , life could be worse i wonder what else i have to do to prepare myself for tomorrow i think i need to go to allie 's room at some point to get her notes from philosophy that i missed last week , and i really need to go return a book to the co op and go by the bank because the stupid people sent me my check card with my dad 's name on it why would they do such a thing oh well at least it wo not be too hard to fix at least i hope it wo not be too hard to fix i am so tired but i got so much sleep last night and i do not understand how i'm so tired after only going to class for an hour and a half today it makes no sense to me maybe i am still transforming into the college life style and i'm just not used to it yet i'm getting very sleepy but there 's no point in trying to take a nap because i know it wo not happen for me i love how i have so many pictures around my room because everywhere i look i am reminded of a fun time with my friends from home speaking of home , i feel like so many people are going home this weekend as much as i would like to go home , i do not think i'm quite ready to leave here yet i do not think i'm settled in enough yet to get up and leave already even if i did go home my parents would not be there because they are going to the lake i wonder if i will see them at all since they will be so close to me now maybe i will call them later and ask oh and i need to call mimi back since she left me a message yesterday i will call her later when i have a few minutes to spare since i know the conversation will last for a lifetime or i guess i should say it will last for a long time it 's amazing how i was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate , and then all of a sudden it 's like they both appeared at the same time , and within five minutes they both left and i'm left alone again in quietness i will most definitely take advantage of that alone quiet time , but then again sometimes i do get bored sitting here by myself they asked me if i wanted to go eat with them but i just ate a few hours ago , i might as well save my meals for when i'm actually hungry right wow , looking up at the clock i never realized how long twenty minutes really is i feel almost out of breath because i have been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes my sister just called but i have to call her back she did not seem to mind because she said that her and her friend jessi would be searching for jessi 's car anyway so i wonder what happened to it did she park somewhere and forget where she left it weird i hope i never do that although it would probably be hard for me to do that since i have only driven my car twice in two weeks i wonder if that 's bad for it maybe i need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works i should probably ask my dad about that so its only four oclock in the afternoon and i feel like its ten at night why is that well i just hope i keep up with everything as much as i'm supposed to because college is definitely not like high school high school is like a joke compared to what i have experienced in only 5 days oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks so about winter break i cannot wait to go home because i think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again i'm sure ill see most of my friends over thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the old gang will probably be christmas break that will be a fun break , and i know it will be great seeing everyone again i wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip hmmm there 's another thing i need to check into because i do not like finding out about things like that at the last minute especially since my best friend who lives in virginia will be in houston for part of the break if i missed her because i was on a family trip i would be extremely upset so i need to figure it out to make sure i will be around wow my eyes are shutting so much maybe i should go get some coffee from downstairs sounds like a great idea and it will probably make my throat feel a little better since it 's kind of of sore i think just getting used to college life and my new schedule is wearing me out enough to feel a little under the weather i ca not wait to fully recooperate so i can feel 100 again then hopefully i will be in a better mood and not so irritable hopefully ! well now getting back to the matter at hand , this assignment although it has been time consuming , it 's probably been the easiest assignment of my entire life wow and that 's saying a lot ! ! ! i am so interested to see what our next assignment is like , since our professor said that there will never be another one like this again our class is huge and i actually saw a second person that i know yesterday when i was walking out speaking of i should probably call that friend of mine well it looks to me that i just glanced up and this assignment is over ! yay )

2004_350.txt 1 1 1 0 0 i ca not believe i am doing this this homework is due on friday however , i am working on it instead of studying for some other assignments given by other professors i am so behind right now i did not even read a page of psy yet why it is all because my sis 's bf lost his carkey ! ! ! i left the book in his car on friday and the result of this i have to wait till monday 1am that 's when he got his spare key from houston ! my room is so not neat right now i need more time ! i went to my sister 's friend 's apartment just now his place is so messy i guess the place that i live in is not bad at all the psy class is so huge i am in tip classes most of the classes are not in the big auditorium i am excited about being a college students i met a lot of new people people from different cities there is a badminton club in ut austin i am joining it for sure i love playing badminton however , in my high school , we only played badminton during pe for a week or so i wonder why people here do not like badminton that much bio is so interesting i like chemistry too however , there are some serious reading that need to be done at home on top of all those , there are in class quizzes and discussion that i have to attend where can i find all the time to do all the thing that need to be done i am spending 20 minutes right now to complete an assignment that is not going to be due in a few days why am i doing this right now , at midnight am i crazy i do need to get some sleep however , if i get some sleep right now , i can never get my stuff done i am going to take a hip hop funk dance class i got my flight ticket back to malaysia i am so worried that i might have to cancel that flight when my bio professor said that the final is going to be on the 18th i thought i might not be able to make it again i had fun during critical thinking class i mean , what is the purpose of taking critical thinking class i do not get it however , the class is pretty relaxing so far i wonder what the exam is going to be like what about chemistry how is the exam going to be like i met some of my siser 's friends i met some new friends as well i am still seeing some of my old friends however , we do not see each other that often since we all have different classes on different time and date on top of that , i have some friends that do not go to ut austin i want to go to san marcos i want a handbag i bought myself a wallet i went to urban outfitters i will go broke if i keep on shopping i do not shop that much i do not really like going to mall my sister loves going to mall i think going to mall just to look for stuff to buy is a waste of time i would not do that unless i am extremely bored sometimes i like to buy artistic stuff am i artistic i do not think so i doubt it i do not see myself as a creative person i love sciences and maths those are my favorite subjects i totally dislike government , history , geography , etc i think psychology is interesting so far it seems to be i am all worn out i had been up since 8 30 in the morning until right now i had a really busy schedule i want to go to my friend 's apartment and start karaoke ing is this the right spelling no one will know anyway i want to go back to houston and see what 's going on over there i want to see my friends in houston sugar land once again i want to go to malaysia and start shopping i want to go to hong kong and eat those delicious food i need to get my homework done so much to do , so little time people who live right next to my apartment are kind of noisy they party like almost every night i totally understand that since this is austin and all of them are ut students i am just telling the truth here no offense to anyone who will disagree on that i want to sleep now but i still need to write more and then do more reading i do not want to be a know nothing person when i go to bio lecture tomorrow i ca not believe i write that much in this short amount of time i hate writing writing is not my strong part at all i like to eat i want to eat sushi right now korean food will do too
2004_351.txt 0 0 0 0 1 the first thing that coems to mind is how much i hate the stupid popups that are getting in the way of my writing and slowing down my laptop the man that invented those should be shot now i'm starting to remember what was said in class about this assignment it seemed like a really dumb assignment to do , but i prefer writing for only twenty minutes versus actually drafting up some essay and spending hours writing and rewriting and losing sleep over it there really is not much too this , which should have been fairly obvious to everyone in class why is it that no matter where you go there 's always someone really really stupid that will ask the same question that someone else asked only a few seconds before them if i was a teacher that would really annoy me it would be fun to put those dog shock collars on those types of people , you know the ones that everyone growns inwardly ( and sometimes outwardly ) at as soon as they open their mouth because nothing good will come out i actually really do like the psych class the assignment is aggravating because i know that odds are no one will ever read this and i'm doing it just for my own amusement i know if i cheat and just copy and paste something or bang on the keyboards for 20 mins , then i will feel bad about it oh well , 20 minutes is not that big of a deal anyways i'm killing time until my boyfriend gets done with his project so i can talk to him again my mind is trying to go into thinking about my bf , but i'm not going to let that happen i know that most people have a hard time making a long distance relationship work when the distance really is not that far all the girls i have met left a bf in houston or dallas i wish that 's how far away he was because i could go and see him on the weekends actually , if he was anywhere in the us , then it would really help , but i knew what i was getting into when we decided to stay together no more boyfriend talk i start looking around the room to think of something else , but the first thing that catches my eye is my roommate 's vase of big yellow flowers that her bf just sent her that 's really not helping i keep thinking about something in spanish , but i'm guesssing whoever might read this ( i doubt anyone ever will ) wo not know spanish so i guess i should write it in english la ausencia para el amor es como el viento para el fuego extingue lo pequeno y the fuerza a lo grande that would translate to , absence for love is like wind for fire it extinguishes the small and gives strength to the large sounds much better in spanish though now i'm starting to remember that anytime spanish comes up , everyone asks how i know it and when i tell them i lived in south america they always ask if that 's where i'm from that has to be the single most annoying question i have been asked so many times , too many times and no matter how many times i explain i'm from dallas , and my parents are 100 american , people still assume that my family must be mexican it 's like asking an oriental person if their family is originally from africa it 's just stupid i do not look hispanic at all everyone assumes too much when i say i lived in south american , they all assume mexico and when i say no , then they think i must have lived in a hut in the middle of the jungle but its not only the americans now i'm remembering all the dumb questions i got when i moved to lima when i said i'm from texas , they all said no you are not , you are not wearing any boots and a gallon hat or they would ask where my horse was , or what happend if my horse got sick and how would i get to school if that happened plus i got all the dumb bush jokes fern used to call me bushwa instead of gushwa , my last name pretty creative though i'm glad he 's happy at harvard
2004_352.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i'm actually really tired , but i want to finish as much homework as i possibly can it 's not terribly late so i thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before i go to bed today was a good day not too much stress and i talked to a lot of my friends and family its always nice when i get to talk to old friends from hs today i met a girl that went to the same elementary as me we did not know each other , but we had a connection because we were from the same town most people have never heard of my town before , so it was pretty cool i also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town , which again is strange i actually met a lot of people , one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other i'm glad to know that i have someone that i can study with or ask a question if i need help anytime i want one good thing about college is that it 's really easy to make friends even if you are a shy person , there 's always someone who is willing to talk to you i used to be really shy , but i do not have much of a problem introducing myself to random people , i actually enjoy doing that now i look foward to those that i will meet tomorrow , i just hope i can remember everyone 's name when i see them again i have met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces i enjoy all of my classes , i'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what i plan to major in it seems that i really do enjoy chemistry and biology , but i'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that i have to do i'm really excited about wednesday i'm going to try out for the rowing team i think i'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people i hope i make the team , but i do not want to get my hopes up , so i'm just going to see how it goes today i went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and i feel much more comfortable with my decision i was able to row correctly , although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement but i was able to row for 2000 meters non stop my first try , and i think that 's pretty good because i only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts i'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team i have not been on a sports team since middle school but i have been in band since sixth grade band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous , but marching can get pretty tiring , and i think that it has prepared me a little for this i'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing in high school , we had to march for 8 minutes straight my senior year i had a solo and i had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical that was pretty hard to play without people realizing i'm completely out of breath but it was really rewarding , i had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games i could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing , but i can play my flute in front of anyone i really wish i was able to be in the ut band i had always wanted to be part of the band , but now my major does not allow the time i hope that later in my college career , i have the chance to be in the marching band at least once i think it would be so much fun music has always been a big thing in my life , i love to play it , but i also love to listen to it my favorite kind of music is country i especially love george strait i have most of his cd 's i know every word to every song he sings , i only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and i will know its him i'm also a big fan of 80 's movies one of my favorites is young frankenstein mel brooks makes wonderful movies , i think they are all hilarious real genius is another good one i like most of my favorite movies i'm able to quote from beginning to end one of the classics is the princess bride there are so many great one liners in that movie my dad and i always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens my dad knows the most trivial things he will know the answer to the most random question you can think of its pointless , but its pretty cool my dad and i are really close , i wish i could be more like my dad we grew really close when my mom passed away when i was little , he remarried , and now i have a brother and a sister i love my little sister so much , she 's the cutest she never uses my real name , she always calls me sister i really miss her but i talk to her often and she 's always so excited to hear from me she just got a new rabit , she 's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died but now she has 2 i hope the heat does not get to these two like the others she 's always really worried about them she also has a dog , and i have a dog named princess my dog is a choc lab she 's really cute , but she 's also really old i'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since i wo not be there for her all the time i have had her ever since i was little , i miss her too i brought a lot of pictures and things from home so i would not get homesick my room is very comforting i think i do not think i could stand it if it were blank most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly she goes to corpus with my brother , so she is not that far away from me we talk all the time online though , so it feels like she 's here
2004_354.txt 0 1 1 1 0 let 's see i'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back not that she 's not a cool person or anything , i just can concentrate better when i'm alone and when it is quiet but that is almost impossibe here in jester there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises like right now ! oh well , it is something i must get used to or i can do what i did last night wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done i stayed there until 1 30 a m i guess i can do my work better at night my fingers are freezing ! this room is so cold ! i have not even figured out how to change the temperature in this room , it is insane i'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i cannot wear shorts like i used to back at home aw , home ! i think i am starting to miss being at home i called the house the other day and my 11 year old brother told me he misses me this , ladies and gentlemen , is something that never occurs i do go back home on thursday night , but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta i am competing in a sports tournament for my church i am playing flag football and running track another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i have been dating for less than a month well , i have known him for about 4 years , but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children 's camp for my church together it 's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13 i went to a dance with him after that , but only because i did not want to be mean he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me that was always an issue for me before , but for some reason , i really do not care anymore he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago me and my ex boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college , we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend a week after we broke things off , this new guy i'm dating told me he had feelings for me i was so confused and did not know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks but i'm normally the uptight girl that ca not let loose and enjoy myself because of that , i decided that i would go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy we decided we would just go with the flow and not really label ourselves my ex found out and was extremely jealous it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy but oh well , that 's life i guess i am really glad i continued to see this other guy , regardless of what my ex had to say i spent every day with him until the day i left i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much he is amazing the only thing i'm worried about is that i will fall too hard and too quickly for him i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i do not think i'm quite ready for another one that 's the only problem i'm having right now the fact that he 's a high school student does not bug me as it used to but the distance might become an issue it was an issue in a way for me and my ex , so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me but yeah , that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut but i am definitely loving it here in austin i enjoy all of my professors and classes having two biology classes and a chemistry class , however , can be tough in addition i am taking this psychology class , which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting other than that i have my freshman seminar class , which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment ah , my hands are still so cold what do i do ! my ears are feeling very cold too must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room ! or my bad , it is the fall now same thing today is the day for my mile run ever since i moved to austin , i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym i absolutely love that place ! and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape ! i find that i have been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer i really love this lifestyle i have at ut the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming , but i do not feel like i am abusing it i did party a lot this weekend , but i did not drink or anything people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset i do not want people to view me as a party girl because i'm not out of control or anything oh well i see that this writing is almost up that was not too bad !
2004_355.txt 1 0 1 1 1 wow this is actually a cool writing assignment i would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what i am thinking for a 20 minute period i have just gotten back from a meeting about the texas lonestars organization and loved it ! the only problem is that i am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing i am kind of stressed out ( but not nearly as bad as i know i can get sometimes ) just because i am pre med and i know that i really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved getting involved , however has never been a problem for me i love to be involved in everything now that is a problem because if i spread myself too thin i am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue i know for sure that i want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions i am going to try out for the roustabouts and the steel dance company i am beginning to get nervous just because i have not really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since i have been away from home i hope that i am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience i know that i am here to get an education , but it 's obvious to everyone that college does not just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career , but it 's also a learning experience for life lessons i feel that just in the week and a half that i have been here i have already become more responsible and determined it has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new , huge city , but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of yey school is over to wow , my life is just beginning , along with lots of studying that i do not really want to do my life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway i know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has the fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like i do not belong yet , the funny thing is that i do not really care or maybe it 's that i do not know how to make the effort to fit in again my first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that i have lived in for the past four years ( even though i lived there when i was younger ) and i feel like it will just be weird to see how my family 's lives have just king of carried on without me i wo not really understand my mom 's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school my dad is perhaps the only one that i will probably still feel just about the same with because i am use to not seeing him all the time my time is almost up and as of right now i am just really hoping that , even though i may not be showing my priority to god right now , he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction

2004_359.txt 1 1 1 1 0 what an evening ! i have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now i am in the worst mood i went with my suitemate to pick up food from taco cabana everything was going good , but then we had to wait forever for our food then when we got to the window , we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size finally , we got our food , and it was right we drove back to our dorm the castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage i park on the end of the row , and it is almost impossible to get in to after ten minutes , i finally got my car in my assigned spot when we were getting out , she grabbed the food and i grabbed the two drinks we had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator finally , it came and we headed up to our room i stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as i attempted to unlock my door as i was doing this , i even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while i opened the door , but i just ignored because i thought i had them i made it in the door successfully , but as i was going to set them down , i dropped both of them all over my area rug irate , i bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and i screamed how much i really wanted a soda since i have not had one all week ! i knew i had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained i proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized i had forgotten the detergent all the while , keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold when i walked in to the laundry room , i whacked my hip bone on the door knob , and even as i type this , i can feel the bruise forming i kept walking towards the washing machines and did not notice a puddle of water on the floor i slipped 3 times before making it to the machine i was so mad by this time that i just decided to wash my rug without any detergent now , here i am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events i get back in my room and the internet is not working ! ! i realize that i am so sick of fighting with the apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm so now , here i am eating the soggy nachos that i paid 6 bucks for all i can smell is the food , but now i'm really not hungry you should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse their tv or radio is really loud and i can hear it from here oh geez , now they are knocking on my door is your internet working it just came back up a few minutes ago is what i told them for a day that was going too good , it has now taken a turn for the worst now i am thinking about the phone call i just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement she did not offer me any words of advice ! things happen ! she said wow ! no kidding ! ! i do not think anything else can go wrong , unless my internet decides to cut off while i am writing this i look around my room and all i can see is a big mess ! as of right now , an optimistic attitude is way out of the question ! i'm seeing my wet school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks wow ! ! i think this is the worst mood i have ever been in ! my room is freezing , my floor is wet , my rug is down in the dryer ( which i have to go get in an hour great ! ) , and my neighbors are a pain in the rear my suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room it is reminding me of an ex boyfriend that i have back home ! he acts so funny sometimes he thinks he is so hard to get when i know that when i go down there , he will come right back to me he 's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home i was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight , as far as classes , and now i am completely set back nursing homework , psych writing assignment , and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that i was supposed to do my stomach is growling because i am so mad it gets like this when things go wrong i hate when things go wrong ! ! my mom 's words are ringing in my ears things happen ! i just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when i talked to you earlier ! then come my suitemate 's words chill out girl ! it 's going to be alright ! i do not think that will ever happen at this rate !

2004_362.txt 0 0 1 1 0 so the first week of school has begun and i am not ready at all ! i already feel like i am loosing my mind which is not a good way to start off the school year i am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors first , i am taking cms 306m , which is a speech class , and that does not seem like it will be too hard then i am taking eco 304k with an amazing professor i am very excited about this class but i have heard that it is a little difficult so i will definatly have to pay attention and study i am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is troy kimmel the weather man ! so i am excited about that because he seems like a fun person ! i am also taking edp369k which is a community service class we have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours i think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business place and get to experience those things that we normally would not this class should be interesting i think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish this class is just something i need to take finally , i am taking your psy class which i am very excited about as well ! pennebaker seems very laid back and cool with the music at the beginning of each class , etc i do not know , i think i might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology ( however that is spelled ) i really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon i am a sophomore so i am not as scared as i was last year last year i was very intimidated so i studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way and in return i ended up with a 3 888 ( which my parents are enthused about ! ) but this year i am not as intimidated , so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing i just really need to get out of the summer mode where i go out every night and do nothing but work and party i need to calm down and study read a bit more than i am now i think i will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days so hopefully ill get my act together soon anyway , on a lighter note tonight was our first chapter meeting that 's right , i am in a sorority alpha chi omega and i love it ! we just went through rush where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing my little alpha sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever ! she knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time ! i just love her next week we get our chi sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our omega sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our lil' sis' which will be ours for the rest of our college years so this semester should be very exciting ! this year i am living in the axo house with my pledge class of '03 and i was not so sure about it last year but i really love it ! i am getting to know my pledge class so much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters however corny that may sound ! haha anywho , we have a date dash on thursday and i am not sure which boy to take ! haha i always seem to have boy problems but o well , that 's all part of being a college student ( i guess ) anywho , there is this one boy who is a sigma chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around and really cute but then there is a wrangler whos name is matt who i kind of talked to last semester he use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started well even though he may be good to look at he really does not have much of a personality ! which really sucks i think he 's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and does not have a whole lotta interesting things to say i mean , do not get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and i tottally trust him and he 's 21 ( haha ) but i ca not help it if i am not attracted to someone i mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at but in a way i feel like i owe it to him to invite him to our date dash but then again i do not want to lead him on and then break his heart because that 's just cruel ! okay , then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex boyfriend ( but in a good way ) he is super cute and very interesting i think i could hold several very interesting intelligent conversations with him i think he could teach me a lot about life in general anywho , my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this date dash and i would love to go with him but i feel like i owe it to these other guys , that i have been spending more time with so right now i am a very confussed person and considering it is monday night i kind of need to make up my mind really fast okay , so there 's the sigma chi names forest who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long term quality then there 's matt the wrangler who is so nice but i would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him then there is ryan who is someone i look very much foward to getting to know better so we shall see how things go i know everything happens for a reason so i will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out ! right well , i have now been typing non stop for 18 minutes i guess i had a lot to get off of my cheast this is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day just let it all out ! haha , good idea ! o yeah , i tried signing up for an experiment project but then i realized i signed up for the wrong day so i hope that does not affect my grade whopps ! o well , there 's nothing i can do about that now this weekend is our first home football game which i am very excited about ! we play north texas and we should whopp some beee hind ! i ca not wait

2004_375.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because i attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19 59 very ironic i feel very tired right now and really unmotivated i have a lot to do and i do not feel like doing anything i wish i could just go to sleep i need a lot of attention from people these days and i'm just not getting it matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it seems very convinient of him but whatever he is acting weird , and different but he does not know or does not see what he 's doing it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and i'm slowly beginning to not care but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school , sleep , and me then to the things that he is focusing on maybe i'm just overreacting though , because i seem to do that so well i do not feel like being here , my head hurts , and i smell burnt popcorn in the hall way i have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5 i do not know what the day will have in store for me , hopefully i will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that 's bothering me i need to realize that i can make myself happy and i do not need someone else to make me happy i do not even know why i'm rambling on about this , its just always in my head i suppose i hope i get a new car my dad said i can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance but who knows what kind of car he 's going to get me it will probably be something crappy like i have now but i ca not complain , something is definatly better than nothing , at least in this case my economics book came in today finally , becasue i was starting to stress that i was going to get too far behind i really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything even though i do try but i need more i need to focus on doing that for all of my classes but economics and chemistry are the main ones that i might have difficulty in just because they are very mathy subjects i might stay at the appartment tonight but i probably wo not because i have such an early class tomorrow well see what happens i suppose i think matts court started already and he did not even call me to let me know that he got to town safely oh well , like i said i'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all , about anything it feels bad to feel like you are on the back burner , or that things have changed , though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change i'm so tired right now i could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow but i ca not do that because i have entirely too much work to do tonight i want to get caught up with my psychology eradings , and i want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake i hope all of that works out ok if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but i'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does i'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt i do not know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me i just hope it counts to him oh well i met with my mentor group earlier they are all really nice people and i hope i get to know them a lot better as the year progresses its a pretty fun experience this weekend should be fun i'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san marcos and go see some people that i have not seen in a long time i hope i can scrounge up something to wear , because i need to do laundry and i need to go shopping , i have like no clothes anymore , i do not know what happened my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if i see her this weekend i hinestly do not feel like going home though it gets too awkward for me i do not know what but i do not really like it i would rather just stay here and study or like watch tv then go home and feel awkward with my family i have so much to do and i'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun i can already see that college is going to be very hectic i hope i can handle it alright wow the time is up
2004_376.txt 0 1 1 1 0 so it is cold in my room it was like that last night too i really have to go to the bathroom wow i suck at typing i think it is because my fingers are cold my feet are also cold too i can hear the air conditioning blowing over my bed and my room i'm so full right now i just had lunch and it was good , but i was starving absolutely starting i have this class today and i hope i do not fall asleep i do not think i will because it is usually entertaining i hope i am doing this right since i am typing , i am focusing on that and not on my main stream thoughts i hope my friend kacie is doing ok , she does not like her roommate and wants to transfer to colorado where her brother goes to school i can picture her sitting in her dorm all alone right now juliana is funny we usually eat lunch together and it is fun she is quiet and a lot of people might think she was a snob , but she is not , just shy tonight i have a meeting to go to for 2 hours that sucks i wonder if my parents are going to come to ut this weekend they said they might , but i'm going to the game on saturday and i wo not be in town on sunday , so i guess we will see did i mention i have to pee i think i did i took my ipod to class today , to biology , and listened to it on the way it worked fine except i kind of felt like a snobby conspicuous consumption person while i was listening to my music the white earpieces give it away everyone knows its an ipod i always am picturing the bus stop i walk past to get to class how everyone is standing outside , waiting for the bus , the shadow of the trees' leaves on the ground in the hot august sun haha , i feel like i'm writing some romance novel or something i have a lot of homework to do today , and i did not do much last night now the refrigerator is making noises , but it always does i think my roommate is at class i have not seen her at all today i wonder what people downstairs are doing this kid thought i was going to eat lunch with him because we just happened to leave the dorm at the same time to go to kinsolving , but then i was meeting my friend so i feel kind of bad , but he went on ahead too its not totally my fault some of my high school friends are out of school now i have class till 5 then the nsc meeting till 7 blah and i have a meeting tomorrow night , and a couple next week this feels like high school again i hope people will wait for me to go to dinner with them last night we went to jack in the box , and i hate fast food , so i got a salad that 's what i got when we went to burger king last week , also i would rahter eat at kinsolving then waste my bevo bucks there mmm thai food sounds good my nutrition class is so boring today at lunch while i got my tacos and was fixing them , and while i got my fruit , i was thinking of my nutrition class and our teacher lecturing on and on about fruits , vegetables , the servings we ned to have of each , that kind of of thing i'm really tired all the sudden my eyes are starting to close i could take a nap before psych but i probably wo not so i still have to pee that 's kind of gross and you wo not want to know that but oh well all my friends keep signing on to i'm but i ca not talk to them because i am doing this only 10 min left ! this reminds me of jogging on the treadmill at gregory , with other sweating people watching ellen or regis and kelly in the morning i keep looking at the clock , praying the time will go faster so i will be done working out should i join crew i might , my roommate is involved , and it would be a good way to work out , and it would be done so early in the morning i just hesitate because i do not want to be exhausted all the time , which i could very well be my friend james goes to osu and he had a fro last year but he shaved it this summer i like it better with the fro because he is a funny kid i'm getting tired of this i do not want carpel tunnel syndrome or anything i do not think i have actually ever typed for like 20 min at a time the girl across the hall from me is not very friendly she is in my bio and chem classes and in my fig also , but she seems kind of snobby and all like i'm too good to talk to you i keep thinking of my friend from hs who is in the psych class too i saw her as we walked out on monday and i was like oh , hey i'm thinking about breaking out my thin mints that my mom sent me right now i wanted a cookie at lunch but they had cake and cookies are so good for some reason kerry just popped into my head what should i do about that should i vote for him i think it was because we did a psych survey yesterday about bush and terrorism my fridge stopped making noises but the a c still is my arms are starting to hurt am i going to die this weekend my brother and his wife came in town from boston for a wedding and we hung out with him we went to barton springs , it was fun after , we got some tacos at this place for lunch it was good i can see us in line at the restaurant ( as a baby i called it a restoot ) waiting to order , me looking around , deciding what to get , if i wanted the drinks that were really good , they taste just like a fruit we got a cantolope one and it was so refreshing i have the worst posture i'm trying to sit up now my friend kc has a yoga strap she uses to keep her sitting up straight owww my arms really hurt now oh band , i was in band last year and i remember marching and all those friends i had from band one of my friends who is a senior now has to go to practice today he just signed online wow , only 2 more minutes !

haha i know that wo not happen ok bye
2004_377.txt 0 1 0 1 0 what do i write about that is a good question , but i guess i should write about writing , or think about thinking the thoughts streaming through my head right now mainly consist of how fatigued i am at the moment i have been running around all day doing errands for the actives , and i just want to sit and do nothing i guess this is almost doing nothing except for the movement of my hands and the flow of my thoughts part of my relaxation method at the moment is coming through my ears in the form of some music jimmy buffet is streaming through my computer waves and out into my room i wish i were sleeping and i wish i did not have to report to the house in about 40 minutes because i just want to do nothing right now i do not feel that physically tired but more mentally fatigued i did not have much class today , so i got to sleep in , but i could still use some rest perhaps i need to get outside and exercise to increase my energy in the future i just do not have much open time with pledgeship at the moment for anything but class i have been in school here for about two weeks , and i think it is really quite a cool set up you do not have to go to class if you do not want to , but it certainly crushes your grades with low attendence sometimes the lectures are really quite boring , but this is never the case in psychology , only my other classes the biggest adjustment i think from high school to college is the format of testing with only a few test grades determining your whole grade one of my annoying friends just walked in the room and is tearing up my room by bouncing a basketball that guy is such a mess and i was not serious about the annoying part because he is cool , but now he exited the room to go find something exciting to do as opposed to watching some guy sit in his room and type on his computer let 's see here , it has been 11 minutes of streaming thoughts and this is pretty fun it is even more fun that this is not graded on content since surely my dull writing is sure to bore any living human i am trying to search for thoughts , but i just realized that defeats the purpose of the exercise because there should be no interruption , just natural thoughts all of the jimmy buffet music is taking me away to the beach and margaritaville i wish i were on the beach right now instead of at school , but its not all that bad we have our own semi beach environment with the river and other stuff around austin but now my hands are kind of aching because i do not think i have ever typed this long without taking a break i am certain that i wil have great stamina in my hands when i am through with all of the writing assignments , and if it does nothing else , atleast my typing speed should increase significantly it is pretty quite around here as opposed to like last night or other days because usually a lot of people are hanging out in our room or playing loud music i like this serenity with just me , my computer , and jimmy i look up at the clock and see i am at the eighteen minute mark , and only two more minutes i feel like this is some type of race , like a time trial or a running race in which i have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong this writing is not so painful as i though because i was sure that i would just go braindead and have nothing to say i do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing looks like i am out of time
2004_378.txt 0 0 0 1 1 ok , writing i started this a few minutes ago but apparently in mozilla firefox the timer does not work sorry if i end up submitting two essays right now i'm kind of hungry my stomach is growling , i have not eaten since seven thirty this morning i did not use to eat breakfast , but now i do one minute down i feel pressured , like i have to continue hitting keys or i'm not doing as well as i should on this writing assignment which is strange because all i have to do is write something , anything , and i get credit for it is it cheating if i use the backspace key to edit my mistakes there are quite a few of them i probably would type better and therefore faster if i slowed down , which is paradoxical but true i am also sleepy maybe i will take a nap , except i have to study hooray that 's a thing about college that is hard to get used to setting oneself to a schedule and keeping to it , studying and going to classes on time without being told what to do i'm thinking about psychology and the hypothalamus , which is what we learned about yesterday the description of the rat kind of makes me wish i was a rat whose hypothalamus was being zapped seems kind of nice , although dying of starvation does not sound pleasant maybe in this case it does i wonder what it 's like maybe conscious though takes a backseat to simple feelings of pleasure , like humans feel sometimes , in the throes of ecstasy ( religious , sexual , or chemical ) maybe the human brain has a natural resistance to feeling too much for too long in order to protect itself from things like dying of pleasure quite a way to go i am running out of things to write about and it 's only been 5 30 minutes my mind is becoming a blank perhaps i can shove something in there nope rub a dub dub , three men in a tub i'm regressing back to childhood , oh no ! forced constant thinking seems to have brought me back to my childhood , which is not what i would have expected if you think about it , that nursery rhyme is kind of suggestive i wonder why i keep bringing up images and thoughts from when i was young perhaps those , being learned first , form the basis of the psyche and are therefore more intrinsic to the mind than say , what i learned yesterday or what i see on mtv mtv i do not like that channel at all i do not like it in a boat , i do not like it with a goat i do not like it , sam i am , i do not like music television the channel that proclaims to be that of rebels and anti culturalists , but is really the mainstream mass produced mass consumed product that everyone thinks it is rebelling against at least they encourage people to vote that 's a positive message coming from a negative source i guess no one or nothing is truly evil well , nine minutes gone i'm feeling stretched , like butter spread over too much bread , as bilbo put it like everything in my mind has already come out and i'm squeezing a juicebox trying to suck the dregs of thought through that straw of course , with a juicebox you can never quite get out all the liquid , and i suppose it 's the same with the mind one thing i never understood about the mind is how one gets from neurons firing and connecting with each other to actual consciousness in the textbook it seems like a step is skipped an analogy can be made ( and has been , i assume ) between the mind and the computer one could say , well , magnetic information does not seem at first glance to represent data and images and text but the former is converted into the latter by programs , which themselves run on magnetic data where are the programs in the mind it 's hard to believe that the human mind just coincidentally has the neurons in all the right patterns to be able to form speech and thought and movement where is the software i'm just rambling now although that 's the purpose of this paper , is not it ha ha i tried to read the book house of leaves , i was told it was brilliant , but you know what it , for lack of a better and more descriptive and more culturally acceptable word , sucks it 's written in a nonfiction style , but the endless footnotes serve only to distract from character development and this wo not make much sense to whoever is reading this if they have not read it speaking of which , hello , whoever is reading this ! i hope you are having a wonderful day although reading hundreds of stream of consciousness papers is not my idea of a wonderful day still , someone 's got to do it , right someone 's got to do all the dirty jobs in the world , until they design an automated way to do it then the worker loses their job which is better , i wonder working at a terrible job , or being replaced from that terrible job and not working at all some day , hopefully , we will have robots to do all our terrible jobs for us we will become like asimov 's solaria thousands of robots to maintain a small human population eventually it will go to extremes millions of robots to one human or maybe not what will be the point of civilization then what is the point of it now to keep people happy great job so far , i must say nowadays people think that what they need to be happy is chemicals more and more chemicals , pills , etc to cure the imbalances in their head they should take a cue from computer repair people the problem is just as often in the software as in the hardware ! biological psychology will go a great deal in explaining human behavior , but it can only go so far people who have no imbalance in their minds but still do terrible things or get depressed what do we do with them eighteen minutes , fifteen seconds have passed quite a while to be writing you know , a second never seems so long as when you want it to be short i love time 's relativity , even though this is not really an application of it if only there was a way to have time speed up or slow down if we wanted it to now there would be a best selling invention it all deals with people 's perception anyway i bet there is a way , somewhere although messing with brains like that probably is not a good idea speaking of good ideas , my time is just about up it 's been a pleasure

2004_382.txt 1 0 1 1 1 sleep ! that 's what i need to do i stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on bond born an electric quartet i asked my roommate that i was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten , but she woke me up 40 minutes later i was not late thank god ! i'm really stressed out , i have so many things to do this weekend why is college so easy yet so hard to manage management , i believe , is the biggest thing in college i miss my family so much i really do not know if i'm doing this right i'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and i'm pressing the wrong keys grrr ! my roommate is leaving today to see her family good for her we were both crying , actually i was the only one come to think of it she said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever how can you not cry i guess i'm very emotional and sensitive i was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried i hope they are healthy and so not worry so much i want to see them and my brothers so bad i'm done with classes and i'm free ! ! i love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness it is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music i really want to be super good on my electric violin after writing my paper about the electric quartet , i realized that i wanted to be like them i actually miss my quartet they all went to the university of chicago and are sophomores there i'm always the youngest in everything youngest in my graduating class , among my friens , at my church that is youth bible group , and even among the freshmans here at ut i feel so old yet so young compared to others here i ca not believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class i was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture they are older than my professor and ta 's what are they doing here at such a old age , i wonder did they flunk , not graduate , drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be ! i was walking out of pcl after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money i ignored him because i was creeped out it is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he she should however , if they are missing an arm or let 's say play the saxophone on the street , i would definetly give them some change i feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them last night , my roommate came in with her best guy friend , who 's bi sexual , and another guy that i later found was gay i really do not mind gay guys although i find it sad , i do mind if they are lesbians ! ! yuck ! i'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things i am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence i really want to keep writing on and on but i have 2 minutes left i love to write especially poems i like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings i guess it is because i play classical music and only listen to classical music classical music , i think is the most sensuous , expressive and beautiful form of art every created i would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs i better wrap up oh no it 's almost time for me to go i will phew the computer is letting me write a little more whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone 's writing well , i got to head off to my biology study group toodles !

2004_385.txt 1 1 0 1 1 i did not sleep at all last night and i'm barely making it through my day i feel like a zombie , but hey what 's new i have an english paper due on monday i think i completely bombed the thesis i guess i can always go back and change it i'm tired , i ca not think that 's a lie , of course i can it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble and that counts too right sure it does i have been seeing this guy he 's about seven years older than i am , and that should not be that big of a deal , but it 's more of an age difference than anyone i have dated before i can meet him on an itellectual level , conversation is not lacking , there 's physical attraction and the whole deal so why am i so doubtful i suppose because i'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl unfortunately i have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again i'm so much stronger now , more confident and comfortable with myself as a person anyway , my point is i'm scared to let him know i'm sincerely intersted because i think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction i can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings and i'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship whatever time it might be is too soon to bring up any of those concerns is he seeing anyone else does he care does he not want to hurt my feelings so he wo not tell me he does not want to hang out it 's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this basically i'm so afraid of rejection that i'm willing to do it myself , before anyone really gets the chance i have dated a plethera of losers over the past year and i'm tired of not caring about anyone anyone in that way i guess yes i have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain ( that sounds really harsh it is me that wants this ) but i miss that connection i want to be in love again but who does not i suppose once i stop wanting it i will find it that 's the way of the world sometimes yeah but about him it is what it is and if it does not work out than so be it plenty of fish in the sea and all that but he does have some potential enough of this it 's making my head hurt i do not like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a dear diary than anything else i'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment i wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now maybe none everyone 's in their own little worlds deep inside their thoughts or their research everyone seems so disconnectced , though i suppose that 's the point of this place a quiet area to get work done , not social hour i'm about to go to ecology evolution and society i have been reading the assigned chapters , but i fear that i'm not actually retaining any of the information i guess it will become quite apparent when i get my first test scores back all i want to do here is to do well it 's the only reason i'm living in austin again , to continue my education so that 's what i aim to do make the most out of the billion things i have to accomplish today cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new life is pretty enjoyable when you do not let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects so many people do that drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless just smile sometimes , it really can make you feel better , and probably someone else as well that 's what i think , but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest the end my time is up
2004_386.txt 1 1 0 0 1 hello looks like a journal entry frustrating blank page as usual , not nearly as much pressure as a true journal might be no , true journals ( at least the ones i know ) come complete with the most irrational , egotistical , subjective criticisms at all here , i might simply start to list adjectives think i will chair , run , cake , spoon , sparrow , harly , make , spy , insult , laughter , organization , economy , complete crap ! ! ! ha ! adjectives are fun what to make of this phenomenal opportunity do not be shy , be compliant or just spew forth venom , anecdotes , general life lessons inclination says talk about me here 's what that is or so we will try music , menus , frustration solitary , isolated , friendship social butterfly making waves the size of anthills , feeling pretty depressed about it the color of the water is green count the levels of meaning there anaphor hyperbole homonyms czech republic czeska republica the united states of my ass could i say here that i want to the president protect identity the blank might have been filled with make love or marry or help through important issues certainly not castrate what else looking forward to making a 's lots of a 's , because after all purpose belongs to those classes in which one might be rewarded for hard work and ass kissing discombobulated this page may be , but organization 's overrated i know a quote one advantage of being disorganized is that one is constantly making new discoveries that one 's right above dad 's desk at the office why do i experience comfort in an environment less than rational or organized possibly the same reason i love psychoactive mindbenders ( by this , of course , i refer to puzzles and games like scrabble ! ) because true beauty in life exposes itself not in the routine , as religious dogma might promise , but at an indian buffet at which one can stand before a plethora of unfamiliar treasures , waiting for the unfamiliar perspective of a western mind for validation what else i think this weekend i'm going to stimulate myself with something organic or possibly inorganic and clean up the house make normal people sense of the place so that when mom and dad show up tomorrow they do not swallow their tongues music makes everything voluptuous , adds another layer to experiences so that they find their way to memory lane more frequently and effectively takeover from an armchair natural delicacies tv numbs , music accentuates , pleasure reading enriches , highest level math and science is god school puts the kind of pressure on people that creates ted bundies ut is anything but a good school , just like college immidiately following high school is anything but a good idea just going does not plant seeds of positivity or success i was the fool , caught in the wave of college matriculation , and still to this day i feel i need four more years just like that fucking idiot gw bush right now , and not because i endorse the use of any of the following terms , i'm going to type into this mind drain a slew of derrogatory or defamatory terms that i rarely use but that for some reason are to come out when i open the floodgates it 's because i wanted to call bush a faggot , or a fucking idiot , or a fucking shithead hyppocrite , but some mechanism that pisses on creativity and ultimate truth caught me in the act and slapped my red hand before any other utterance could follow well , here , you fuck , stop this ! ! ! ! oh , i was going to go into some racial slurs , but that 's just so stupid how about cracker ass whitebread honky guerro americano puto ! that would be perfect for me still , something about waspy racial slurs is not nearly as intimidating as nigger or spic or daggerhead , or whatever this world exists as a cesspool of religious dogma , hate , and a need to evolve it 's going to suck till that evolution takes place , but god damn it , i will wallow in the shit till i die and i will like it could not qualify , for that reason , as the typical good people one might imagine a large percentage of those floating around earth for some god or cause might hope that 's what makes music done thanks for the toilet !
2004_387.txt 1 0 0 1 1 ok , i'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing , and unfortunately since i have been told i type rather fast the professor to teacher 's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of mark 's mind i hope that no one reads this seriously at all ok now someone is watching me type , oh they are gone that was fast , i'm telling you this is a waste of time and i'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes i'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un interrupted thought would yield so little i miss my wife yeah that 's right my wife we are not legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and i do i certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because i actually do take it very seriously i love her more than life , more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath now i will write about pizza hut they got this buffet that 's only 3 99 , not bad , but the same as cici 's so if they are pizza is not far superior than i will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal i know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and i will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement i hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children i will do whatever i can to ensure this i love my wife so much i miss her terribly there seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how i have many a time disputed the reality of free will how can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally because if i had full free will i could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that i would be judged for my actions on earth but since i could not choose whether or not i could be exposed to such information i am a catholic this is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person but the truth is that i consider myself a part of this religion yet i do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion for example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me my idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this good people go to heaven bad people go to hell simple right except what i qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good so what now is my idea of good right or is theirs but wait , the plot thickens i have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem you see i believe that god instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good the most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something i find to be unacceptable i can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable i am almost always right in this aspect every time i have seen something i think is wrong i can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong however , they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions the hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions i am not proud of all that i have done in my life the only reason i can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because i apply this theory to myself and find it to be true i once actually cheated on one of my ex girlfriends one of the worst days of my life there is no reason i can use to explain my actions but i did it to end the relationship yeah , i know what you are thinking good job huh well she did not want to leave anyway at least that was what i thought i was so damn confused i cheated on her , a rule i set for myself a long time ago was that i would never cheat on a girlfriend and i did i disgraced myself and i hate er hated myself for it i did it to invoke another of my rules for myself should an infraction upon the rule about never cheating on my girlfriend i must then break up with her because she deserves better than that i do not know if i'm wrong but i could be man you know sometimes music can just totally change one 's mood now i'm listening to damien rice the little known writer of some of the best music i have ever heard i think he 's great it 's kind of weird i guess for a guy to like some other guy 's music so much but i do i also like this guy joseph arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me their style of singing their lyrics are all so real i love the way i can relate to it i recently read a streetcar named desire the female role of blanche she is like my ex she lies , decieves in the name of giving people what they want never tell me what i want only i know that and i do not appreciate being told if anyone ever makes assumptions about who i am before i meet them i get reasonably angry but i hide it pretty ok you for some reason i have been descrimanated against for being mexican twice in my life both times by a girlfriends family i have an extraordinarily pale complexion the funny thing about that is one of them is mexican heh what can i say
2004_388.txt 0 0 0 0 0 oh boy , the first writing assignment i hope i am doing this correctly i ca not really think of anything else right now i sort of have a slight headache todays speech class was very boring i am still bored because of it sitting down and listening to one person after another talk and talk still has me a little bored what else can i say i am still bored because of it my mind is still a blank i do not know what i feel my apt is sort of warm right now , so i guess its a little warm in here i can hear my computer buzzing above everything else i guess that can start to get annoying after a while oh man , its only been two minutes thus far 20 min of writing sure will suck well , i still do not know what to think i'm still bored i'm now starting to think about a friend of mine a special friend , who 's company i enjoy very much she lives back home in houston , and i occasionally see her on the weekends , although i have been talking to her online quite a bit lately she is definetly someone special now i'm thinking about another friend of mine who is over at my apartment constantly although this guy is a friend of my roommates , he is also a friend of mine , but through our mutual friend he 's always over , always this guy can get annoying , and when ever he comes over , he just annoys us i'm a little annoyed just thinking about him right now now my mind has drifted to ice cream we all had ice cream last night it was good stuff , but i think i had a little too much we went to cold stone creamary on the drag now my mind has drifted to the ice that is still sitting in the freezer its just a little pint of bluebell ice cream that pint has been sitting there for about a week and a half now now my mind has drifted to my dad , who paid for that ice cream when i when i bought it using his credit card account i guess i thought of him because he would smack me for going out to eat ice cream when there is perfectly good ice cream at home now my mind has shifted to another friend of mine who just called me a minute ago , but i ignored his call because i am doing this writing assignment this guy is a cool guy , i like him he went to my high school and now goes to school in san antonio his girlfriend goes here to ut he 's probably coming up to see her and to hangout with me and my roommate now my mind has shifted to a looser guy i know that my friend from san antonio does not like this other guy also goes to school in san antonio these two almost got in a fight two weeks ago , and although i'm a passivist , i hope my friend and this other guy duke it out , for the other guy is also coming to austin this weekend for god knows what reasons i thought it was funny seeing the two argue , and almost fight although if the two were to fight , i think my friend would beat his ass now thinking of san antonio , my mind has shifted to some other buddies of mine that live and go to school in san antonio some of these guys went to high school with me as well , some did not i wonder how they are doing its been a while since i last talked to almost any of them , and i just wonder how they are doing maybe i should go up there sometime although i have been saying these exact words for almost a year and a half now oh boy , another seven minutes to go damn that 's a long time i'm still thinking about my buddies from san antonio now i'm thinking about a friend that went to ut , from san antonio , who unfortunetely flunked out of ut i think his parents were not too happy about it , because i have heard they have enforced some harsh rules for this guy to live by now another friend called me , but i ignored his call as well now i'm thinking about my friend who just called me this guy i have know for almost 18 or 19 years , quite possibly one of my earliest friends he just graduated from ut last semester and is already engaged i'm sort of both happy for him and sad at the same time happy because he will be married and doing what is expected of everyone to do to get their wheels in life rolling yet sad becuase i know things will be different once he 's married for example , he wo not be able to hang out quite as much , although i'm sure his wife will be more than happy to let him go out every now and then and also becuase he will have other things on his mind that a married man would have and just probably wo not feel like screwing around with his buddies any longer , or rather at the same level of screwing around he did in his college days what ever the future holds for him , i know he will be happy , and for that reason , i too am happy , for him that is well , its about another two minutes to go , i hope that this will end soon and now i see that my friend is washing the dishes that belong to my roommate and i , which i do not thin she should do i think i will stop her when i'm done wtih this assignment another couple of seconds to go till i'm done yippie
2004_390.txt 0 1 1 1 1 well , i'm not exactly sure what to write about i just finished my prescreening for the psychology experiment stuff and i now have to 1 5 credits for it so i only have to get 3 5 more i guess to get the 5 i hope the experiment things are not anything to bad and they do not take that long i hate typing when i have rings and bracelets on i really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy i do not know how i'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes i just took my bracelet off , it was really hurting i have so much homework to do this weekend i guess teachers ( professors ) think that since it 's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work i guess the professors do not realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too i also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend i have to go to dallas to see my half sister because she 's in the hospital for something , i really do not want to go though we never talk anymore and why should i go see her when she ca not even call me when she promises to oh , i met these friends at ut they are so great one of them really her name is sarah and she 's really nice i think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one i have this year she lied to me about everything and i think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something the other day i heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy 's dorm i do not know what they were talking about , that is just what i heard carol is talking about sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping she thinks sarah is so cool i wonder if what i eat is actually eating a lot or if i'm just eating a normal amount of food i try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food is not always great oh , kinsolving is not all that great some of the food is good , but i ca not stand eating there every day they need to have food on this campus other than chicken i love chicken and i used to want it all the time , but now since i have been here i have been dying for beef the other day i was so stupid i was talking to carol on the phone and i said , i'm tired , but i do not want to lay down i'm bored but i do not want to do anything i'm not hungry , but i'm dying for meat i bet i sounded so stupid i drove home today from austin i really did not want to becuase i have not drove anywhere in like a month , but i really need to start driving again i ca not wait till i get to go to casa ole again i ca not believe austin does not have them here that is like the stupidest thing in the world i take that back the stupidest thing in the world is that ut does not sell dr pepper anywhere ! how can they do that ! if you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer , the majority of them would say that they like dr pepper the best my mom just woke up i finally found one places on campus that has it though the union has dr pepper at the taco bell i have not checked anywhere else yet my dad is talking about this guy 's truck that got stolen today i ca not believe that happened they live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here my dogs are fighting i have two dogs , milo and brewser milo is a red beagle that is brewser 's son and he turned a year old may 15 , 2004 brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on october 11 , 2004 it 's weird to think of their age milo is really crazy and brewser is really calm it probably is because he is so old though i felt so stupid today in biology we had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question , i sort of knew the answer but i did not have it completely right the second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard when i was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in if , then form meaning that this would be an example , if we put this together , then this should happen in this class though , its just a statement no ifs no thens no questions it just made me feel stupid cause i could pick the hypothesis out of the group there there was the last question that she asked and i had no clue about it all that really scared me though because i am afraid of not making it in austin here at ut out of my high school we had 106 seniors out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or army out of those 59 , 35 went to atm i ca not get over that only 2 of us came to ut and that is me and my ex boyfriend , nathan i am afraid of what all my atm friends would say if i could not make it here i really do not know what to talk about i keep making all these stupid noises just because i ca not think of what to say my sister is now watching who wants to be a millionaire and my dad just ate some m ms my mom is out feeding milo and brewser oh , milo is actually mine i was too young for brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad 's carol has a dog , ferret , and fish at her house in temple the dog 's name is bart carol is laughing at me because she is reading what i am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world i have to say , that since i have been writing it , i have to agree i think it 's kind of cool , but i really do not see the point in having to write this all out well , i understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information , but this sort of seems like a waste of time oh , well i'm getting credit for it oh , i might get to go to my first concert pretty soon i'm going to try to get to tickets to the austin city limits thing sarah and gabby were telling me about it and while i was in class today they tried to go get tickets gabby got one but while sarah was in line , they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her

really cool i ca not wait until i get to hang out with steven i really missed him while i was in austin stupid nose itches i do not understand why randi and i seem to not be as close anymore its kind of sad she has been my best friend for 5 years its really ironic that steven is now my best friend who would have ever thought do not come crying back to me when you are lonely and all out of love is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific song its a very nice song very simple , yet it manages to me a very interesting i ca not believe that i still have 17 minutes left to type its usually very hard for me to type stream of consciousnes , i have tried it before in a humanities class for some reason i ca not ever seem to really put what i'm thinking on paper that 's why its hard for me to write or keep a journal i even lie to myself on paper i wonder why i also wonder why mikey is the way he is with me i ca not believe i ran into him last night he completely ignored me that really hurts my feelings because we were really close at least i thought so i really need closure i hate myself for not hating him my nose is running again now it 's getting in the way of my typing i am so stressed out right now about biology the house is completely silent right now except for the washing machine the dorm is never this quiet i think maybe that 's why i like the dorm because its loud ow , i just hit my ear that i just pierced its really sore the pain only lasts for a split second though its not as hot here in amarillo as it is in austin the weather here for labor day is perfect i think i will go and walk my dogs i just sneezed again i am sick of sneezing stupid

anymore maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday i really missed my dogs zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me he licked me all over i love dogs so much but its ironic because my dogs

2004_392.txt 1 1 1 1 1 i'm just sitting here in the library wondering if this semester is going to get a lot harder everyone of my friends is struggling in some way or another i keep asking myself whether or not i'm am going to make it in my major my major is petroleum engineering and its not exactly the easiest major my friends say they do not know what i got myself into , but i keep telling them i will be fine to not worry about me when i say this i am just trying to reassure myself instead of trying to convince them that i will be fine this library is all to silent i think i just want to make some noise but that would be wrong to mess up all these people who just feel there barely grasping the concepts of what they are doing while i'm sitting in the library my mind keeps wondering whether or not i am going to make an a on the chemistry exam on tuesday i feel bombarded with chem and i do not know if i am going to be able to remember all three chapters my mind keeps telling me that i will be fine that i just have to get used to it high school was so much different than college in that you had to much time you did not know what to do with it that hasnt been my problem lately the only problems i have had all are about having not enough time every time i talk to my girlfriend back home , a senior in high school , i tell her to take advantage of having a lot of time on her hands because college is no where near as easy i know older people had told me the same but i really never believed them and always felt as though they were exagerating oh yeah i am getting off topic but this library is just boring me i feel that everyone is ahead of me on everything i feel like they all grasp the ideas that i do not in high school i was ahead of everyone of my friends but now it seems to me like all of my friends are ahead of me maybe that 's just me overthinking i can now smell some food as though somebody has brought something into the library it smells like a piece of chocolate maybe it is a candybar of some sort i do not really care because that smell kind of nauseates me i am not a real big fan chocolate but i do love chocolate ice cream something about the sweetness is to much for me to endure lately i have been getting really home sick because of my girlfriend i miss her very much and wish she would move up here right away she is graduating a semester early from hs and is going to move to austin and attend acc for the remainder of the year i offered for her to move in with me and she said she would ask her parents i hate to say it but her mom is a good for nothing lazy ass her father moved from italy to america in the early seventies with not a dollar to his name the man now owns a 30 million dollar business that he started from nothing he now works twelve hour days and then comes home to make a three course italian meal , not spaghetti out of the jar , for the whole family while the mom just sits on her computer or plays tennis all day all she does is just bitcht at the whole family to do things she is one of the most ungrateful people i have ever encountered in my whole entire life people who have only met her once or twice do not agree because she puts on a show for them but i see the real her everyday
2004_394.txt 0 0 0 0 0 wow , i haven' sat down and typed for 20 minutes in a long time i guess we will see how it goes the first thing on my mind is how great living in an apartment is i love not having to deal with anyone such as parents , siblings etc the main benefit to this is being to sleep late today i woke up at about 1 p m and did not hear anyone tyring to wake me up like when i am back home anyways , life seems to be treating me preety well right now i still miss my girlfriend , but i try not worry about it i had become too dependent on her and i think i lost a sense of myself a little bit now i have plently of time to find myself again the football game this week was a waste of time i left in the second quarter when it was 33 0 because the sun was beating down right on my section and it sucked all energy i had right out of me but , we won , so i'm not going to complain about that anymore i just looked at the clock for the first time and its only at 6 minutes it feels like i have been writing almost 20 m , inutes already i bet its because i'm still tired after this i'm going back to sleep for 2 or 3 hours and then i will wake up and do some laundry i hate laundry , but i guess it has to be done i have let it pile up like and idiot and i probaly have 3 or 4 loads to do today let 's see , the three day weekend was great , and what makes it even better is there 's only 4 days of school until the next weekend the more i think about the nap i'm about to take , the more drowsy i get i absolutley love naps there 's honestly only a few things better than being able to sleep whenever you fell like it the best time to take a nap is when you hae nothing to do and need to pass some time like after this i know that 's probaly not the best mentality to get the most out of life , but its not the worst if i need to stay up , its no problem in fact i'm tempted to just hit finish , go sleep and come back and do this but that would be just plain stupid my apartment is a mess right now , but i cleaned the other day and my roommate had friends over last night , so its his turn to do some cleaning i'm looking forward to some cold weather , because i ca not stand sweating when i walk to class , which is what has happened about every day ok , four more minutes i could do this all day and i'm sure eventually i would say or at least of something useful or interesting but i do not think its going to happen in the next 4 minutes it sure as hell did not happend in the last 16 but that 's okay , because someone doing assignment is writing a great paper in high school we had a english that made us do this kind of writing except we had to do it 4 times a week for a month we were studying transcendenlism ( sp ) which i personally is all b s anyway we were supposed to find a quiet place in nature , go there every time a write for 20 minutes i did not go to my place one time and made up the entire project the night before my grade 95
2004_404.txt 0 1 0 0 1 i just opened itunes and chose to play miles davis 's album called a tribute to jack johnson the first song right off begins with a strong groove this music first puts me into a pretty good mood it motivates me to want to go to the gym or something and get a little exercise now the song is quieting down a little bit after a few bars and slowly building back up larry coryell is on guitar i believe , if not i'm pretty sure it 's john mclaughlin now miles is playing gosh he 's quite an impressive player he 's not showing off by playing a note every second he takes it slow and builds up a good improvised melody and they are always good too i would like to choose the songs to play before class starts sometime , to give people a chance to hear very respectable music that most kids nowdays seem to neglect upon hearing , because of a difference in style from the popular , well advertised music of the 90 's and 00 's or otherwise some people are not even given the chance to be exposed to it my roommate just came in the room speak of the devil , eh take him for example when i first met him and asked what he listened to , the first two things he said were metallica and linkin park both of which i am not biased against or hold negative regard towards actually i find both bands to be quite interesting i was exposed to metallica and that very broad genre back around the days of middle school , and definately listened to it quite extensively side note it 's getting hot and i'm turning on the fan could this music and the pressure to write as fast as i can be causing my body to heat up that could be quite interesting going back i find it weird , well not weird but sad basically , that people like my roommate have not heard and do not seem to be immediately open to new musical tastes new meaning previously unknown as opposed to recently released the song just phased into an ambient sound while miles is playing over it the drums , bass , and guitar have dropped out when the jam comes back in and here it comes oh yes well done movement ( change ) in music i have realized ( as a good explanation ) is what creates uniqueness and good sound change can include any part of sound pitch , tempo , tambre , etc now it 's just the bass and miles on this album is billy cobham on drums , herbie hancock is on keyboards i'm not sure who the bass player is off the top of my head my roommate is playing video games behind me i understand his addiction i used to play games all the time throughout middle and high school i went to an arts high school for music and sadly games distracted me from studying music and my academics obviously i did well enough to get into ut , but sadly not well enough for my own standards , although i did not realize it at the time i quit playing games during my senior year in high school , picked up some other bad habits , but since moving to austin for school things have changed nicely , and although i'm not completely comfortable with the status of my lifes general direction yet , i guess i feel slightly better and more able to concentrate on the future although the future is quite unexpected , otherwise i do not really know what i'm going to do the song just dropped into a drum jam with a guitar riff running continuously over it and time 's up

2004_416.txt 1 0 1 1 0 today was a long day i have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep chemistry 301 , i have found , is really kicking my butt i made a seventy on the quiz , but i think i could have done a lot better tonight i'm going to go see shrek 2 with andres and the guys i ca not remember if it is any good or not , but i guess i'm going as an excuse not to do my homework one day i will get around to reading chapter three in psychology this weekend i'm taking bethany to oklahoma to go see bradley and jon for brad 's birthday party oklahoma city is such a far drive from here i think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then i have to drive another thirty or so minutes to edmund for the actual party i'm going to meet mom sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal i have not had one of those for so long well , actually tim 's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to mexico , but that is not the same as my mom 's cooking after the unt vs ut game on saturday , which might i add we kicked their butt , about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to mexico spur of the moment tim 's parents have a house in laredo his dad works for a m international university as an athletic director hmmm i am running out of things to talk about now october 8th , is the aubrey homecoming football game and my friend niki has to crown this year 's queen so i'm going home for the weekend to see everyone i miss everyone a lot but i do not as much as i thought that i would high school was great but college is so much better although , i would have to say that even though i was the valedictorian and i did not have to study that much in high school , college is so much more difficult i think i will probably change my major a few times too i know for sure that i want to do something in the medical field with children but i have no idea what i want to major in before i get there and would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so i can finish this assignment ! ok its just andres wanting to know if i am going to watch shrek 2 at jester tonight at 8 i wish that i could have went to party on the plaza today but i had so much to do it was nearly impossible i had a tip mentor meeting at 5 , which is when my last class ended but i had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a tip seminar that was about notetaking now how boring is taking notes about notetaking that is almost as bad as the seminar i have to go to three times a week critical thinking is thinking about thinking yuck ! could not the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that i mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker anyways , then i left the notetaking seminar early to go to women in medicine the speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired i could not imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see i have 20 20 vision right now but that does not mean that i'm a good driver i have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks two weeks ago i went to dallas to go see my friends in a band and i ended up staying in waxahachie until 8 in the morning when i was coming home the next day i stopped and got coffee before i headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later i dozed off i had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile i ca not believe i keep doing that it is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree my dad called this weekend , which is odd considering he just decided to flee last christmas and not tell anyone where he was going he said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure i was ok i'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream the reason why i wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird if he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future just kidding ok well here is the countdown i only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me ok my time should be about up now yeah ok i'm done the end !

2004_432.txt 0 1 0 0 1 right now i am sitting here typing , with the tv on in the background and i am feeling very tired i think this is because i did not get nearly enough sleep last night why did not i get enough sleep , you ask well i do not know i usually go to bed sometime before eleven , or sometime right before twelve and sometimes after twelve i guess you could say between 11 and 12 , right yeah and i start my day somewhere around 7 30 that is not nearly enough sleep but what 's funny is this is the only time of day when i feel really lethargic around 5 or six o clock maybe it is biological maybe we all feel tired at certain points according to our bodies i think there should be a law that we all have to take siestas in the afternoon like they do in mexico that seems glorious not to mention it 's good for you ! you are more refreshed and able to handle tasks more efficiently and with more energy even as i type i can feel myself drifting off do not fall asleep do not fall asleep oh great i pressed a wrong key and now the time started over i had two minutes of typing under my belt that 's beautiful , just beautiful ! ! ! i think i will just sit here and make up for that time doop de doop doop de dooooop well , i'm very glad it 's friday tomorrow not that it makes much of a difference , but still i can sleep in on the weekend , that 's a big deal to me i'm not sure what i will do with the weekend probably catch up on reading for classes i'm really concerned about that i have been slacking off a bit and that 's just awful , classes have only been in session for what , just two weeks or something yuck i'm such a procrastinator well , i do not know what else to talk about this is boring and i'm getting bored just doing this because i would rather be napping not to mention the clock says only 3 minutes and i know the true time should be somewhere around five ! ! ! ! here , this is entertainment i will type out a poem completely from memory ladies and gentlemen , the road less traveled by robert frost two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler , long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i saved the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way i doubt if i shall ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i , i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference what a beauty of a poem , no i have always liked it do not remember why i had to memorize it probably for a class way back in middle school some people have told me they do not understand the last line i just feel secret annoyance towards them what 's there not to understand ! it 's clear as a bell , people ! i like robert frost here 's another one i know called fire and ice some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what i have tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice i think i know enough of hate to say that ice is also great and would suffice i also like stopping by woods on a snowy evening , the one that ends and miles to go before i sleep yep also that poem called nothing gold can stay why do i know so much about robert frost you ask ! heck you got me i do not even know i just think his poems are nice what other poets do i like that 's a good question i have no idea well , that 's probably not true , but i ca not think of any at the moment in decathlon in school we studied lots of poems , by langston hughes and sylvia plath and robert frost ( a really bad one , though ) and george meredith and lots of other peeps some of them were cool , some were most definitely not i think i will write a poem of my own , right here , right now i call it the cat came home the cat came home and he thought he was there to stay but what he did not know was that the owners had moved away they left the lights on they left dishes in the sink the cat came home and in a swift minute did not know what to think should i stay or should i go the cat asked himself that day what should i do about this what should i say well the cat found no answers just an empty litter box so he said , eh who cares and tore up all the socks maybe i should get that one published ! well my time is almost up thank goodness , so i should think of an appropriate end to this free writing assignment , a summation if you will this was mainly about poems and poets and the unsolved mystery of why i do not get enough sleep yep , that 's all nothing too exciting and what do you expect there is absolutely nothing worthwhile on tv at this moment
2004_439.txt 0 0 1 1 0 my thoughts are everywhere right now i am thinking about getting my computer fixed because it has a virus i need to sleep that is the biggest change for me in college is the late nights and busy days i am used to busy days from high school but not the late nights it is strange but interesting and fun being semi independent i have another late night tonight that i am not quite ready for but it is my pledge line for ka which will be another consumer of much of my time but it should be very fun once pledgeship is finshed i am looking forward to getting to meet and become close with my pledge brothers because being from a smaller town i do not know as many people as a lot of folks down here but i did not want go to school with all my old high school friends really because i wanted to meet new people i do miss my best friedn though he is somebody i could always talk to trip out with and just we knew what we are thinking without having to say anything it is strange not having a best friend down here right now and its tough because it takes lots of time and lots of escapades and wild nights bad times good times high school sports all those things made us great friends and now i have to try and make some more friends like that here in austin my roommate just left and i am still trying to make my decision about that situation he is an alright guy but he is not really the type of person i see myself spending lots of time with but i am sure i will being roommates and joinin the same fraternity but i always look at it as it could be a lot lot worse lost my train of thought sorry i'm having trouble focusing today i feel very out of it but i have got class in a while so i wo not be able to take a nap i think i am getting sick and rundown hopefully i can shake this little congestion i have but with all the new stress in life these days i do not know how well that will work out i'm not feeling to great at all sometimes i wonder if ut is the right place for me and that is just a backand forth thought cause some days it is and some times when its a bad day i wish i was back home in my own bed with dog i miss her haha that sounds so cheesy haha but she is a good dog and she always will cheer you up i can hold a thought today it seems like i feel like i am being random but some how i feel like i keep saying the same things i am not looking forward to walking to class i do not like that very much and i get to search for the computer shop to drop my laptop off to get this virus taken care of that is a pain i feel like i havent met enough people yet i want to be more outgoing but i am naturally more of a quiet person i enjoy listening and watching other peoples behaviors and stuff i like to feel people out and get a sense of who they are before i just start relaxing around them i try to be assertive and approachable and outgoing but that does not always go so well and people take my quietness in the wrong way it is often seen as me being stuck up angry rude and that drives me crazy but all i can do is be who i am
2004_440.txt 0 0 1 1 0 i enjoy doing writing assignments liek these you get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really do not have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart i wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be whether i will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class but among those thought , i also wounder how this semester is going to go i hope that i am going to be able to do well enough to bring my gpa up so that i am able to get more scholarships fo next year man , when i notice what i am thinking about , i notice that i really think about things that may affect me in certain ways like doing homework for my classes or whether or not i'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills but as i take the time to think , i feel that i will be forced to get another job so that i will be able to afford all this new responseablity that i have taken on its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time but right now its hard for me to do anything when all i'm thinking about it how bad i feel right now right now i have a stuffed and runny nose , and i am also sore from working out on wensday it hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy i think i worked myself out a little too much , i feel that i tried to push myself a little more then i should have since it was my first day working out since last semester i think i screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break all i did was work to pay off some of my bills that i acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and so not pay attention to the time , time really seems to fly by take this assignment for example i started to write what i was thinking and now that i look at how long i have been writing , i have noticed that i have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it it merely seems like i have been writing for about 5 minutes if all the assignments were like this one , i bet pretty much every one would do good , cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time you can just about write about anything you want , whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest , all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too
2004_447.txt 0 1 0 1 1 i havent really decided what to write about so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like i could write for a very long time i do that though , i have a journal and its handy i like to go back and read what i write and think to myself 'what an idiot' its a learning experience really , and i hope more people use journaling to express themselves some people use online journals which at first i thought was odd because i write personal stuff in my journal i would not want the internet world to read all that but then i started reading my friend 's online journals and actually started one myself katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she 's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she would like to be different that reminds me of george , he is the classic conforming nonconformist he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates especially lauren their relationship is odd in that way george makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us he is an interesting person to study i am always observant but observing him is just interesting he 's like a girl and i swear he has pms we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he did not want to go to the lake with the rest of the group ( david and i did not want to either ) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually but then the next day , he still did not want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we could not decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea he just left he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he 's cool so he will do and say things to seem cool and crazy he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night i do not know if i belive him but i really do not care the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr popular of course he was not really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you do not care he is such a confusing boy i mean , they are all confusing but he takes the cake having liked him before , i knew what i was getting into the last time and the time before that his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky ! so now i feel bad like i'm just judging everyone i know grr that 's a noise i make , i make many of them i make many faces too at work john laughs at me because i ca not control my expressions especially if someone says something dumb i just ca not hold it in my moms the same way i wonder if that 's learned or inherited anyway speaking of mom , my parents moved to florida in feb and march it was ok at first because i was of the opinion that i was getting an apartment so i would not be living with them and would not see them much anyway but man i was wrong i visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached while i was there dad did the same annoying things he 's always done , not listening , asking questions i would just asked etc drove me nuts but now i miss them a lot i was listening to avril lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home and i realized that i have no where else to go this apartment is my home now and man that 's depressing the kitchen is dirty , the floors are dirty , we need to steam clean , lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out my cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak people would call this bitterness i like to claim that at least i'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like i tend to do i took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website it said i was an estp i think anyway , part of it said that i would tell people what i think i do not know how correct that is because i am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much all my friends will say crap jill is the most tactless , when she and sean got together i was quite angry and still when i think about it i get angry at her why not at him i do not get that but when i typed his name i accidentally wrote sew i am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because i keep thinking of things like today as i walked across campus i was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make i have wanted to do stuff like that for a while but i just did not and now , even though i'm busy with papers to write etc , i really want to get creative lauren 's sewing machine is here still but it did not work very well i ca not remember how badly it ran but i should probably check that before i buy one i do not know how much they will cost either i think 150 at walmart but i do not want a plastic one i'm sure i could break it and i would rather have machinery than plastic i think i should inheirit mom 's old one and she can get a new one but i said that once and she said no way whatev i'm tired i tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 i think i do not remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks and i have been doing it for days that 's probably not good another thing that 's probably no bueno is that i hate my job and this is not like the first year i worked at culvers and i was just a lazy bum i am good at my job , i do it well , i used to enjoy serving customers but now it has been really hard to make myself go and its not like i'm just going to call in sick , i just do not want to go i want to hit almost all of my coworkers , the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager i do not get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place ! and he 's weirdly energetic and since lauren and david have told me the same , i know i'm not the only one whos creeped out by it well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago

2004_455.txt 0 0 0 0 0 hello , i do not know why i feel that i have to greet you , but i do and i do not know who you are , because i have never tried to communicate with myself that is so strange to me because i should know me well , because i am me so a stream of conciousness , eh lets begin with the first thing i look at the keyboard it is black , and the lettering is in white , capital letters i know each of these letters by sound , and sight how did i learn these with out them i would not even be here doing this now i am hearing things people all around me logging onto their computers just typing away , researching away now a man is asking a question to one of the information people here i do not know who they are , like how to adress them , that is but they are here to help and for some reason that makes me feel at ease at ease from what i do not know i guess the world is enough to make my being feel uneasy my existence in this world makes me feel like i need to be recognized , sensed , felt , heard , or loved is not that strange why do i need to feel this way i do not know but that 's how i feel moving on what is another sense i have gone over what i am looking at , what i am hearing and what i am feeling but feeling in an emotional sense , not physical i could have said i am feeling the contact between my fingers and the keyboard , but instead i chose to elaborate on my internal emotions , and that is not one of the five senses is not that strange so that covers three out of five what am i tasting right now well , i do not know how to answer that i do not know how to describe the taste of my mouth and even if i was still eating , how could i explain the taste of a hot dog or fries or a banana the only thing i could say is that my mouth tastes like hot dog , fries and banana but that is not necessarily what it really does taste like right now now it tastes like nothingness , i suppose what does nothingness taste like i could ramble off synonyms , such as void or empty space even but that does not mean anything untill a person consciously experiences it right like when a person learns what strawberry tastes like there is no possible way to explain exactly the flavor of a strawberry mmmm strawberries are delicious that 's all i would be able to say and now i am actually craving a strwberry ! even me typing the word , and the big capital way that i spelled craving makes me want it even more i am now trying to take my mind off of the mouthwatering fruit so that i can finish the last three minutes or so of this paper before i leave to go get some strawberries it is a pretty strong urge for me to leave now but i have discipline and that is what makes me different from everyone else i have discipline i wo not leave now because my grade is so important to me and its paying off , you know why because i only have 30 more seconds to go ! ! ! i am very happy now at the hought that i do not have to type any
2004_456.txt 1 0 0 0 1 i'm sitting in my dorm room and it 's very cold i do not think we control the temperature in our room because sometimes it 's hot and sometimes it 's cold no matter what temperature setting we put it on i'm borrowing my roommate 's computer because i do not have one yet my dad is going to bring it up hopefully this weekend when my parents come for my brothers soccer tournament i also want him to get me a new cell phone because my phone book is full on mine and i ca not put any new numbers in it which is difficult considering we are in college and i'm meeting quite a few new people many of the people i met because i went through rush and also i have met a lot of people on my dorm hall i'm living in srd the food is pretty good but i'm really picky bretani was eating mushroom soup today and i think soup and mushrooms are gross she said i was missing out on so many great things because i was so picky but i do not like to try foods i have already got preconceived notions about as being not good i like pizza i really miss eating dominoes pizza on friday nights i was thinking about the zebra thing we talked about in class and i was wondering that if zebras are always releasing cortozol ( not sure on spelling ) and their immune systems are always being shut down in response , then why are zebras never sick would not they be sick like all the time or are they sick and we just do not know it maybe you would have to do some serious research on zebras to find this out at least that 's what me and claire concluded i'm glad that claire is here with me at ut even though we were not like really really close friends in highschool i have known her since kindergarten which is pretty remarkable to know someone for that long from kindergarten to college i mean i have been calling a lot of my high school friends mainly when i'm bored like when i was waiting for the bus the other day for like thirty minutes seriously it took so long and the guy behind me had a pizza and it smelled so good i go visit jeff a lot ( my bf ) because i think about him a lot and i wish i could see him at least every day but that might not be possible considering i have a lot of home work i have to do and all the other stuff i'm going to be responsible for once school and equestrian team gets going and it 's sucks because he does not have a car so he ca not just drop by even though i drop by his place like all the time i did at home too i'm always trying to surprise him or make him happy and it just sucks that guys do not get girls they are dating impaired almost all of them suffer from this ailment i would say i mean some things seem so obvious for him to do to just make me so happy little things i mean and he does not even see them but as long as i'm complaining about jeff at least i'm not going out with andy i ca not see how bret ( my roommate who i know from highschool ) can go out with him he 's such a close minded person a lot of the time just a jerk and everyone who meets him get 's that first impression from him too and i just think bret is way too good for him but for some reason she loves him and i know he loves her and he 's not a bad guy but the other day talking about wanting to live with a gay guy like will and grace or be friends with a gay person he was like well then you would just be condoning that life style omg what a freakin aggie seriously , he 's such a hick i ca not believe he would be so close minded but he is and his ego is so huge and bret is pissed off at him all the time and the long distance relationship thing just is not go to work so iwish she would just dump him because i think he 's a jerk if he was not her bf i probably would not even be friends with him yikes any way i can really get carried away on that issue i miss going out to the barn everymorning i'm afraid i'm going to gain weight because i do not have the motivation to jjust exercise and i do not dance everyday like i used to and i just ate two cups of ice cream and even though it 's fat free bret says it still has like a jillion calories and i do not even really know what that means entails but it sounds like something that will make me gain weight and i guess i'm just really concerned with that i also do not know about this whole sorority thing i'm a dg and the girls are great but sometimes i just wish that i had gotten a bid fro chi o because i spent like hours killing myself over that decision and i got dg in the end anyway and sometimes they baby you and you are like uh i think i can handle life here thank you very much but oh well at least you have people watching out for you whether it 's a little annoying or not and it does make me feel precious karolyn stopped by last night just to tuck us in and that made me feel special sometimes i go crazy learning about psycology because sometimes i think it 's just ridiculous to study why we do things and you know like if you sit on this side of the room will you be more likely to eat spinach or something because i just wonder why we study it instead of just leaving it alone and living it it just seems like a scientist was really bored one day and unknowingly decide to start a study of something absolutely crazy i do not even know what i'm saying but sometimes i do not care or want to know why we do what we do we just do it ! and that 's it why should we stress ourselves out trying to solve the mystery of everything why not just live it man i drive myself crazy sometimes i'm going to eat a red hot fire ball now actually they are called atomic fireballs i noticed that last night me and jeff are going stargazing on the rlm tonight i hope it works out because i do not know too much about it ok did it not even bother bret when andy made that incredibly ignorant comment about being gay because he says jerky stuff all the time and somehow she just sees past it to how wonderful he is
2004_457.txt 0 1 0 0 0 i hate escalators do not know why i have always just hated them or maybe i'm afraid of them too my right foot feels really numb and not comfortably numb like that pink floyd song just numb pink floyds ok , somewhere up there with verve pipe and nirvana there 's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me he 's wearing a fedora that 's covering his eyes he looks cool fedoras are cool i wonder why guys stopped wearing them i mean they look cool , especially in those old film noir movies like the big sleep i have no freakin' idea what that movie was about the plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was ok some girls next to me are chattering giggling i hate it when people giggle that way its annoying i hope i do not giggle that way then i would be annoyed with myself i wonder what it would be like to be somebody else i mean what if i was the guy resting back on that couch would i be the same person in someonelse 's body or someone different i wonder if a different body makes you be different i wish i had my cd player with me life sucks without it then again , it will suck either way so i guess the cd player does not make much of a difference i'm humming the tune to something stupid cute song though what the hell was up with sinatra singing that with his daughter freak but he 's a cool freak the weather here is always so damn sunny i do not like sunny weather , it gives me a sun burn i like it when the sky 's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain that 's my kind of scenery always has been do not know why i'm yawning now , even though i'm not all that tired i wonder what the girl next to me is thinking she looks like she 's in really deep thought maybe she 's thinking about lunch no , lunch is over dinner yeah , maybe she 's thinking about dinner i ca not wait until this week is over what time is it there 's never a clock when i need one life 's inconveniences i'm looking at my wrist , at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it hope i'm not late to class then again i was early to class the other day because i had my watch on upside down my nails are too big , i need to cut them before i get a hangnail or something my foots still numb , i wish the bloody thing would wake up since i have got a class to get to i miss my friends back home hell i even miss my paranoid , stark raving lunatic of a mother how pathedic i need a new pinky ring , this ones all rusty and broken down but i'm too attached to it its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway hey fedora guy just woke up yeah , he 's stretching his legs now i wonder if my leg will ever move now i wonder why people ca not fly i mean who wants cars and airplanes jets when you can fly that would be cool i wish i could fly but i would not want wings , those would be too annoying to take care of i also wish i could play the piano but i guess desire never equals talent reminds me of saliaree amadeus was a great movie great story fedora dude is gone now , some other guy has taken his seat he 's not wearing a hat , but its ok this guy 's got long eye lashes and a pointy nose pretty cool i wonder if someday i will wake up and everything was just one big nightmare that would be great i could start over but knowing my luck , i would just make the same mistakes
2004_458.txt 0 1 0 0 1 it is a beautiful day outside and i hope to enjoy it as best i should i am listening to one of my favorite bands this song matches my mood perfectly i feel like i should be doing something with my life and i'm not , and it 's very har to get along in this university without feeling lonely now and then i find beauty in very conventionally ugly things and this is why i love photography so much the pictures i have up on my walls reflect my personality a lot there are so many aspects of me that people never get to see and it hurts when they judge without knowing me personally i see in color in the sense that i see the most vibrancy and brightness in everything my room here is finally starting to smell lik ehome and that 's one of the first things i notice when i come in i'm glad i ended up at ut i thought i was kind of chickening out by coming here it 's the only place i applied to i'm a freshman this year and i really hope to get out in 3 years , since i have 34 hours of credit from exams i hope i can get out in 3 years because i want to feel good about myself and not feel inferior to my peers i have a lot of issues about who i am and that 's why psychology fascinates me so i understand a lot of who i am more than most people my age i'm feeling very wise right now and although my boyfriend is a year older than me , i sometimes feel years older than him i might want to marry him someday and i worry about that i miss the way things were 2 years ago when i was carefree i feel very burdened and i sometimes think i'm not experiencing college because i feel that way so often i have always had so much to do that when i do not , i ca not relax and i get really anxious if i'm not stressed out i think i'm missing something when i watched president bush speak last night i cried because i'm so worried that he will be reelected i am an avid kerry fan and feel passionately about politics and when i hear bush lie and make empty promises and see people believe what he 's saying it affects me deeply i want to make a difference in the world someday i hope i will grow to be someone great my past relationships have been sneaking up on me recently an d things on that front are disturbing an dmaking me feel regretful i there are some things that i remember so perfectly about the past and i do not know why they stick out i know that there is something special inside me and i hope i can do something great in this world i remember going to europe two years ago and feeling so happy with myself and who i was and i do not have any clue about that anymore i find peace in knowledge wondering stresses me out i used to write a lot of poetry and i still feel just as expressive but now the words do not flow as well i think that as i have grow up , my poetic naivete has faded as has any talent i had i feel bery inferior to people that do not know me they look at me like i have no self worth and it bothers me i am a government major and a psych minor but some people think because i'm in liberal arts i have no direction in my life and that is so frustrating it frustrates me when people think i am stupid i have almost no tolerance for ignorance yet i get mad when people do that i am very analytical , mayb eoveranalytical , and its gotten me into a lot of trouble in my life i miss conor and what we had a few years ago and i miss our friendship i need to feel safe and comforted in order to be successful and i am very dependent on other people in my life to do that for me when we were not 100 miles apart i miss justin in many ways and that bothers me he was the most detrimental person in my life and still is so far and last night i was thinking about those three days that were the worst in my life and there is only 1 thing i can do to get past that i do not know if i will ever one of my main goals in life is to be understood and i feel very misunderstood by people that do not take the time to get to know me and i feel that the first impressions i give are not very accurate i am very emotional and i know that just thinking about certain things will make me burst into tears it makes me feel inferior to do that i feel guilty when i cry because things could be a lot worse i want this world to improve and i want to help it do so i need a lot of love ramon and i have something really special he makes me feel so loved we have been together for two whole years and i want to be with him forever i want to make him happy and i want him to make me happy until we are old and i want to share everything i have with him i was not sure about that until recently but now i feel more passionately about our relationship than i ever have sometimes i cry out of neither sadness nor happiness and its hard to explain to anyone else it feels like i cry out of understanding a complex emotion that i never was able to before if a song really touches me and i connect to it i will almost definitely cry i think that makes me special i think i am more compassionate than most people music is one of the most powerful mediums of communication there is it makes me feel freer than anything else except possibly

2004_462.txt 1 0 0 0 0 i do not feel well at all , i wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about a girl sometimes i do not know why i am still with her can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying why am i doing this writing assignment now my stomach and head are killing me i should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what they think , i'm more interested in what other people think about i mean i alrdy know what i think about , its boring to me , what about the people i do not know , what do they think about , that 's what i want to know i know that girl down there is thinking about something , some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls , that 's what they should be working on , why learn about depression , figure out what girls think about honestly , i do not think a single man can tell me what a girl is thinking at any given time , half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast what 's the deal with that ! i am still feeling bad my stomach wo not stop hurting , i think i need to get something to eat i need to get feeling better cause i already have plans for tonight , and it sucks going out when you do not feel well when i go out and i do not feel well , i get extremely annoyed with everyone that i am with it 's probably because they are having more fun then i am i have noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics , in every class i go to we talk about bush and kerry yes , 3 more minutes to go on the assignment , but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand in my spanish class we had a 30 minute discussion about economic poilices , how does that help me with hola como estas this assignment is not bad , its like the people that have journals , who put there mind on paper
2004_464.txt 1 0 0 0 0 it is really cold in my room , my roommate likes it that way and for some unknown reason it is a lot colder in our room than it is in the rest of the apartment , so we walk around and it is hot and then we come into our room and it is freezing awesome , i hope i can make to class on time today cause writing for 20 minutes might put me a little late , oh well it is history and i usually do not go anyway , and why is that why is it that some people are extremely motivated to do well and make the good grades whereas there are people like me who could honestly care less is it the parents i doubt that cause mine are extremely motivated i am wearing jeans and boots today , and my roommate told me that it was wierd cause i do not look so goofy my mouse just messed up if i can make it through this whole writing assignment without losing my wireless internet connection i will be extremely impressed , sad huh anyways i really want to go to arkansas this weekend for the game , one of these years i am going to get a ticket to every texas gamand go , although this would be the year cause they really do not have any games that are that far away my roommate took psycology last year , did i spell that right anyways i do not think he had to do anything like this i need to call my mom , havent talked to her in a few days , she likes it whenever i call i do call home a whole lot more than the rest of the guys i know , i am such a mamma 's boy i really like the shirt that i am wearing lime green , some say gay , i say nice yeah really nice , man this is starting to get hard and i have only been writing for 8 minutes , i do not know if i have thought for 20 minutes straight in my whole life i really do not my brain just shuts off and i space out especially during class sometimes i wonder if i have that add crap i have always been told that i do but since i made good grades in school they never took me to go get evaluated or anything like that school the only thing i miss about high school is football , that was my life , coach always said it would be the best time i ever had but i never believed him until i was done playing and trust me it was i mean i have a lot of fun in college meeting new people and getting drunk all the time but i really miss playing ball this damn song , my roommate plays the same songs all the time , never good songs , and yet he plays the same ones over and over again , hold on i have to write for psyc , be there in 9 minutes , he wants me to read something for him coke , i love coke for some reason , not that is tastes good cause i really do not think the taste is good at all and yet i drink it all the time , like it is an addictive taste addictive , i think i have a very addictive personality , if there is such a thing , like snuff , i never would have thought that i would start having cravings for snuff , and yet i do like right now , where did i put my can oh man this sucks ca not find it , i can wait untill i get done only 6 more minutes , hands are starting to get a little tired of doing this , had a dream last night , and i think in it i called my ex girlfriend , sometimes i have dreams with her in them , and i do not know why , its wierd , do not really care for her or anything , just sometimes she is in my dreams , speaking of dreams i could use a nap right about now , man i slept till 10 and am still tired , whatever happened to that this is the guy who would get up a 530 to go to the weight room everymorning in high school and i come to college and now getting up a 10 is early that is like 4 and a half hours later , i could quite possibly be the laziest person on this earth , just might be actually , they could conduct a study and i think i would be the laziest except for all the homeless people , twice in a row , he has the song on repeat , how in the hell could somebody listen to the same song twice in a row , ok i got to say something not again i do not even like this song he put on now , ok this one is not bad 1 more minute , cramp in the forearm , am i going to make tat fica plant looks it really good i really hope you do not look into as long as i submit it is very hard 5 more seconds i ca not wait done

2004_468.txt 1 1 0 0 1 so yeah i finally get to the point where i feel like i have some sanity in my life , and back he comes why did i let him back into my life i went out last weekend and had the weekend from hell first the fire alarm , then the game ( not too bad ) , then the car accident ( thank god none of us were involved ) , and finally the other two ambulances in front of halcyon why ca not just go get a damn cup of tea without the world come crashing down on me ( improper grammar , i kmow so is the punctuation for that matter ) so anyway , back to jason the bane of my existence and the one thing i cannot escape last night i decide to try an dangerous tactic and back him into a corner just to see what he would do ( probably should have left that up to the professionals namely advisor jes who did it with me to get me to pick a concentration , classics or middle east ) found out it does not work as well with relationships esp with a guy who has taken over a year to make up his mind and still has not really decided anything talk about making me feel completely worthless so i say , you are still a kid i know so grow up , jason be a man make a goddamn decision i ca not be with you why does he always run my brother did the same thing what is it about men that when faced with fight of flight emotionally , they always run so unwittingly i cornered myself as well i realized i ca not let this man go , no matter how bad he is for me i will continually put myself at his mercy , despite the fact that he was the one who left me this summer why do i make it so easy for him to come back is a little bit of fear a healthy thing he 's not afraid to lose me at all ! because he knows that i will never go anywhere too bad the fool did not know that i loved him as much as i did now how do i get that back i was crying on the windowsill just one more part of the apartment to be initiated into my life with tears i was hoping the sill would have been initiated in other ways he promised to come visit me this coming weekend was shot to hell thanks to et second time that bastard has screwed up my life so i make him promise me the weekend after only thing is that i had plans to celebrate my birthday with my friends that weekend football game club fun night now he 's coming , hopefully but yet more plans put aside for him he would say , but i never asked you to do that , or , you are the one that wants me to come why does not he get that i hate living like this , and it 's his torture that makes me have to put my life aside so now what do i do i call him all day , playing phone tag , hating the hell i'm in but i keep my composure if anything i have learned in this last year of hell it 's how to keep my composure not enitirely sure what good that does me damn this keyboard is spongy wish it had that new full size one that has flat keys like a laptop should make it much easier on the cts so what was i thinking oh yeah , phone tag i finally get to talk to him while i'm in the bathroom ( wow does that gross him out ) and i ask him if we can just pretend last night did not happen and he tells me i'm paranoid fool , you told me you coul not be with me and i'm not supposed to be paranoid wtf ! geez , i write a lot in 15 mins this picture above the computer in the lab is interesting , not really pretty poor taste in art these people so then he starts falling asleep , as ususal , and the conversation dies and each time i try to resurrect the thing to achieve some sort of closure , i feel like part of me dies too how many buckets my tears would fill over this past year i could not count i'm so tired of crying it 's frightening that sometimes it 's the only thing that makes anything better and even more scary that i cry just to get a response out of him because he doesn't say anything ! ! ! the silence is pure torture and he must know it but nothing ever changes do i sound like i have abused spouse syndrome emotionally abused tortured dead i wonder what these girls would think if they read over my shoulder what would sameera say do if she knew i was putting myself through hell again for this man time almost up thanks for the opportunity for the release 5 4 3 2 1 done
2004_470.txt 1 1 1 1 0 i am watching t v and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town which i do not even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time i like that movie 50 first dates i said that because i'm watching t v oh i already said that well any way i am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so i wo not have a lot to do during the week i'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also , but he will be here on friday i wish he was not in san antonio right now it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio and now he 's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing i pray to god that she 's i had one of those pop ups come up because i am on my slow , old computer i watching the monk i love the monk because it 's mysteries and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders it 's a marathon and i'm starting to get tired of watching it i hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up i like both of the sisters but venus has not won in a long time so i think it 's her turn to take the crown i am almost half way through this writing assignment i keep reminding myself that i need to take a look at the experiments so i can sign up for them i forget how many hours i need oh i just looked at the paper , it says 5 hours i do not know what to write because i have not been involved in a lot of interesting activities i wish my friends lived in austin then i would not have to rely so much on seeing derrick i hope this is not the same monk , it is so i need to change the channel i do not know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that i hope that was not intented man , there is nothing to watch on labor day i hope i got my class code right because i did not write it down that was not very smart now i'm watching the source awards from two years ago on bet i got to find something a little better to watch i just changed to what not to wear i think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me , but then i would be affended that people do not like the way i dress i have always wanted to be a model , but as they say it takes money to make money i have this filling that i might win the lottery but i guess everyone has that feeling i love to talk about what i would do if i won the lottery i would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad i would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore i would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because
2004_471.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i am watching an italian movie called respiro it basically about a crazy woman in a little town in italy it made me wonder what etitles someone to call another human crazy or even a lunatic also what emotions should be those o someone different i feel that maybe those whact in their own way are freer than those supressed bya society why do we have to follow the same pattern as everyone else care about politics informed of what happens inthe world speak two or more languages and communicate to each other and try to conprehed different cultures wonder if the gobalization will end in making sa homogeneoussociety will we everget to that point were we can finally agree taht we are the same or is it gona be like the constant fighting in the middle east were ina documentary i hbo a little palestinian boy stronly beleived that there would never be peace in his land how can a little boy be so certain think is incredible because i am not even certain about what i am even writting or thinking here are soe beliefs so strong that they ca not be stopped were do they come from if tehy are all in our minds is there a way to make them change thugh science could we washed brains in the search for peace probably not i just feel such an espectator in a geat movie and not doing anything i also wonder if ill ver be recognized at some point or may ill just go unnoticed i guess i already understood that you meet different peope at different times and ou will always oose contact with them and the proess starts again so should i try o make the greatest effort in becomingtses peoples fiends or just use them for he time being and move on my computer does not work and my roommates keyboard is old and the buttons get stuck whoever reads this assignment si going to think i have horible spelling should i care i care about the assignent because it counts twards my grade , but shoudl i care about the opinion in the graders head apart from them just rading it i do not know what to write i guess the thought taht have been in my head the most recently welll my best friends mom is dying of cancer i do not know how o deal with te situation wha do you tell a friend it made me woder what to do with my tme because i can not even imagine what would it feel like that your time si runing out i'm not going to saysomething like live evryday to he fullest and all that hallmark stuff but i do wonder what you think at night knowing you going to die i do not think i would be scared of dying , but if not doing everything i wnated to do in one life time also believe that its incredible how many thoughts g on in our heads i could never write the all it will take a life time
2004_472.txt 1 0 1 0 1 i am excited about being a columnist , not because i like the daily texan particularly , although i do , it 's more about the opportunity it offers since i can go on to write for the dmn or the statesman once i am out of college and i can get internships at newspapers during the summer so it will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding , i will be able to get better at writing , get some more exposure by writing for them , and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom , i do not know if i can write columns for a living , it could be a lot of moving , its not a very stable job , i do not want my family to have to move around the country with me but i obviously ca not leave them behind and i think i want to have kids at this point , that does not mean i actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but i still ca not ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household , but i ca not worry about that stuff right now , right now all i can do is leave my options open so i can make good decisions later , so basically all i can do is write as well as i can and make good grades , i do not know exactly how to do either but i do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others , that means i need to go to the utlc finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well i can do on my own , i'm sure help from others can only cause improvement , i'm excited about the football games this weekend , as much as i love going to ut home games , an away game means that i can eat while i'm watching the game , it does not take as much planning , i can watch it with whoever i want and i do not have to worry about painting myself , the fact that some of the guys who want to do it , sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult , i would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig , also , i do not know how well the other fans will respond to our painting , its kind of a hellraiser tradition so i do not want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them , however , this is longhorn football and there 's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited , i'm a little worried about what i look like without a shirt and there 's not a whole lot i can do about that before the next game but i will do what i can , i'm bored with classes already , i havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since i am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so i can actually live in it , its not much use to me otherwise , but it seems like the more i do , the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless , i have never lived by myself before and i havent lived away from home for that long , i have always been very dependent on others , especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since i do not live in a dorm anymore , i miss that aspect of living in public housing , the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times , having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over , they do not want to study , they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so i guess the solution to that is to get things done while i'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target , i need to get some groceries , i do not think i know how to shop yet , i still havent made a grocery list longer than 12 items and that 's not enough when i go to the store once a week at most , i'm sure things will get easier once i get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but i'm anxious to get to the point where i am secure with my living situation , my friends , my schedule , and better at time management
2004_475.txt 1 0 1 1 1 stream on consciousness , this is something i have done before , when i was writing my diary , i though it would be a cool idea , i wrote down a lot of stuff , some having to do with music , some having to do with my boyfriend he 's a good guy , i miss him sometimes , well i do but i do not it 's not really an active missing , it 's a passive missing , like i know i do somehwhere in my heart , but it does not hurt or anything i wonder what that could mean everyone always asks me how long we will last , and even though i'm not sure , i guess well last a long time , i mean its already been a year , which really does not seems so long anymore , only a few weeks maybe , until i really think about it then its much longer even though it all does not add up at first it makes sense somhow you know it all makes sense when you look back at it all i tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses , as if to switch subjects , not really to well actually sometimes , to reflect on it but i always inevitably move on , i wonder if that 's what veryone 's like if they all reflect on their thoughts like i do , then move on or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next there has to be someone like that , somewhere maybe in china or some other country , but some where i refuse to think that people all think the same , not only because people are inherently different but because even if 99 of us wer the same , there would have to be at least one person who 's not that 's just the way i think ellipses are fun , they provide space , and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach i'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device , but ellipses are ( thoughts search for word ) something that people use woah , a mental stumble in words , i wonder how oftne i do that i do not think i realize when taht happens , that reminds me of foreign languages i like foreign languages rightnow i'm taking dutch but spanish is the one i'm most versed in i think in spanish sometimes , its kind of fun , and i have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own i used to think when i was a little kid that that would be impossible then i though itd be incredible , now that i can do taht it just seems like fun , i like it , it feels comforting somehow i'm not sure why it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible though i will probably do only four or five someone in my class has a father that knows seven i find hat amazing , it 's simply amazing what the mind is capable of medicine is fascinationg to me , not just the cure type , but the physiological aspect of the human boday , and the relation so the psychological part of the human body , has always fascinated me , even when i was younger i suppose i have always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path , and in a way , to this exact moment in time perhaps only to point me in another direction ( looks up at light ) not all the lights in this library are lit , i wonder why maybe its because it would be too bright , or maybe because the sun is still out , or maybe some of them burnt out i wonder if there 's a pattern ( searches for pattern ) no , there does not appear to be a pattern not lit lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row , lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row ( lost her place ) ah well worth a shot i search for patterns in things a lot very scientific like that one police officer told me i sounded like a doctor he asked me what i was going to ut to be and i said i was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said you sound like a doctor , in the way you tlak i though that was kind of weird at first , but very logical i am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people , though they are not always right in my head when i say them they come out right , and not only that but i love biology , and finding out what makes us tick , and wen i'm in an argument i try to see all the sides and to see what 's underneath it all for instance i try to see what the ohr person is saying and why what makes them say that why they say it the way they do i'm going to like this class i like psychology psych mind ology the study of i was in medical terminology actually the class was called health science tech , but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting , i worked at the hospital but instead of money i got grades , particiapation grades reall it was fun , even the parts most would consider gross i enjoyed it but i do not think i want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital i think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library , the keys are not the easiest to push they stick a little , on some letters more than others they are like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them , but a little looser they are not quite tahat stick at all but still they seem so loud the guy outside in orange is drinking coffee i like orange soda its my favorite color and soda , good stuff i wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble if people had a bubble of consciousnes , it would be their immediate surroundings just basically what they can touch , or what they can comfortably read i wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they are like what type f people they are , if people really do have type basically , what they are like inside ar they analytical , whimsical , forward thinking are they lacadaisical what are they like am i really one of them i kind of think i might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other maybe i'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice , heaven and hell , earth and water

2004_478.txt 1 0 0 0 0 ok so i just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the zta house wow the most pointless thing ever i read maybe 10 pages how am i supposed to study with 50 other girls there in the room you do not have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where , and blahblahblah i know they have good intentions in making us do this , but 4 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study no one really got anything done but hey it was fun i got to bond more with my sorority sisters ! speaking of sorority stuff , i love it at first , i was afraid i would not like it , or that the girls would not like me , but i could not be having more fun i have more friends than i thought i would have going into college , and they are real friends , too , not friends you pay for with sorority fees i'm listening to music right now , and recently ( as in the past couple of months ) i have gotten more and more into music i have always loved music , but ever since i dated a great guy who is a complete music person i have liked it even more today kyle and i ( my aggie ex boyfriend ) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much it was funny we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because , of course , it would not work but now that we are all settled in , we still miss eachother it got really serious really fast it was unbelievably random we never thought we would hook up , but it happened and it was awesome i hate to say it because i'm so young and i hate it when people say things like that , but i could quite possibly see myself with him after college like permanently that 's so weird well , sincewe did break up , we are allowed to hang out with other people ( date wise ) but neither of us really wanted to last week i met this really cool guy from the woodlands he 's an ato pledge i have gone to a couple parties with him as his date and i kind of have a crush on him it 's exciting , but at the same time , i'm far from being over kyle the whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down , but i still feel bad about it i have constantly had this entire soap opera on my mind for the last week nonstop the cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability you never have to wonder if he likes you , or if he 's going to call and all that with a new guy it 's always like i wonder if he likes me and why did not he call worrying it 's fun , do not ' get me wrong , but it kind of puts ur confidence in check i have recently gotten into maroon 5 again i used to love them , but working at hollister and hearing the entire cd all the time made me hate it i do not work at hollister anymore , so i havent heard maroon 5 in awhile , and now i love them again

2004_481.txt 0 0 1 1 0 the speakers that are connected to my computer are extremely cheap i only purchased them because there was a 15 mail in rebate with them it would be really nice to have a new computer , this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow i am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other , they are like two little kids every waking hour i'm with them they are constantly harassing each other my computer monitor is really small it makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes college life is really not what i expected i'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to houston i guess i just need to get acclimated to austin and college life once i do i'm sure i will enjoy it very much but until then i will attempt to go back to houston as much as possible luckily a lot of my friends also attend ut , they are definitely making the transition more bearable every one of my classes has over 100 people in them this is a big change from my 20 people honors classes in high school it does not really allow me to make relationships with my professors raquetball was really fun i ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous yeah i do not think i spelled that word correctly i will have to look it up in the dictionary when i am done is this assignment done yet no still 13 and a half minutes to go this is the first time i have ever written a stream of consciousness i know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 17 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence i think its title has the world ullyses or it is written by a ullyses or something i know this because my father appraised me of it just useless trivia i guess i enjoy watching trivia games on tv , mainly stuff like who wants to be a millionaire or jeopardy but maybe that 's just because normally there is not anything else on the world series of poker is enjoyable to watch as well i was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because i did not really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write , but now that i'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page definitely not what i expected i have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment i think i have ever had whew only 8 minutes to go the printer next to me is running out of ink , which means it will have to be replaced pretty soon which means more money out of my pocket you have to be thrifty in college that 's for sure my budget is 500 a month and this month alone i have already spent over 800 i sure am glad that i received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents they were sure proud of me when i told them about the scholarships i received it felt good to make them proud my brother is smart and does extremely well in school , i hope i can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college college sure is much different from high school a lot more studying and my studying skills are not nearly up to par considering i almost never did it high school now i know i need to study to do well in school so i am , but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter a lot longer than it seems like it really should i guess maybe i'm a little bit too stressed out about college i'm sure that once i get used to it , it will be one of the best experiences of my life but until then , it 's still hell my friends are in the living room , i told them before i started writing this not to disturb me for 30 minutes , but who knows if they will obey me my one friend john loves to just barge into my room i played raquetball with john and joseph i suck at raquetball but hey it 's only my 3rd or 4th time to play it none of us are really are that good the lie detector test in psychology class last time was cool my hands normally get really sweaty so i'm sure i would have sent that sweat o meter off the charts , i wonder why my hands are sweaty a lot
2004_482.txt 1 0 0 1 0 well i guess i will just write about my college life or what has been of it so far well i guess the bad news for today was that i think i failed my first astronomy quiz maybe i should of studied more maybe i should have paid more attention in class who knows but hey they drop the lowest quiz grade life has been very stressful lately with starting a new job and just trying to make time for everything its almost impossilbe i mean there is just so much to do read for classes , study , but still have time to hang out with your friends at the time the people i am most hanging out with are those from my home town good old del rio texas the land of amistad i do not know if i was suppose to make a lot of new friends but for the moment they are the one i have most been hanging out with i mean i have grown up with them and they know me ! i guess i just feel comfortable around them because we have a lot of things in common and besides when ever i need i ride home they are there my roommate is also from del rio the town where everyone knows everyone most of my family lives there and well looking back a lot of high school drama goes on everyone in high school always has something to say about everyone else i mean its terrible its hard to believe i was in all that drama as well yeah well my roommate is my best friend and well you know living together is much more diffrent than just seeing each other everyday at school but hey we are hanging in there no major fights or anything , you learn to adapt since she does not have as much reading to do as i do i just learn to go to the study lounge and well i do not mind all that much it makes me study since there is nothing else to do there but well back to my life in college i started my job yesterday and its lots of fun just because you do not really do much and well you get paid for it its like the people in the office are looking for things to make me do so today i was shreding paper then well i was suppose to go to this free pizza and bowling for the tip this program i'm in that is suppose to create a small school enviroment in this big school and well when me and my friend monica showed up they had eaten all the food so well that went that idea , we just ended up eating at wendy 's its funny how you seem to cling on to those you know rather than meet new people i mean me and monice did not quite get along in high school but now its just kind of we put up with each other just to have someone there she has 2 classes with me and well none of my other friends yeah the phone rang so i lost my train of thought and well now my roommate came in so yeah where was i yeah about people from my town i miss my parents and well i guess the town i little bit when i was there it was fun the first couple of 15 years and then you get into high school and well pretty much all you want to do is leave there is only so much you can do and well crossing the border and getting drunk it not on my top list of great things to do like it was some of my fellow classmates but my parents are very special people to me and so is my boyfriend , i do not know they always seem to understand me no matter what mood i may be in or anything like that , i guess we all turn into terrible people sometimes , but not on purpose my mom is like the most loving person and well so is my dad i have just always considered myself to be lucky to have such great people like them as my parents so understanding and just giving giving to other people giving of advice and well just anything they have to give the time has gone pretty fast in this thing at first i thought it would go by slow but no it has gone pretty fast and so to continue with my day i walked back to my dorm alone from the union and well sometimes its good to be alone and well the school looks so much more peaceful when there are not a lot of people trying to get to class and well the way back from somewhere is always so much faster and shorter than when you are walking to get on time and you just get frustrated because the sidewalk just gets longer
2004_483.txt 0 1 0 0 1 yaaaaay i'm doing psychology things i'm really tired and i wish i did not ' have to study so that i could go to sleep i also wish i could type faster i'm glad i'm here because being almost anywhere is better than being in baytown except for being in houston houston is all concrete and construction but ut has squirrels and lots of them what am i going to say in the whole 20 mins i have to say anything i want will people actually read this i guess i do not care if they do because i'm the type of person that thinks it 's pointless to write for my own enjoyment i get enjoyment out of other people reading what i write and then them enjoying it hmm i miss my boyfriend even tho he made me angry last nite he 's still a nice and good boyfriend on another totally random note i have got this pimple on my face hahaha it hurts ! and it bothers me too ! i want it to disappear ! not that it makes me look bad i actually think it makes me look somewhat cute ! hahah that 's kind of weird oh well i wish i had a memory card for my playstation so i can finish final fantasy 8 at this rate it will take me years to finish it but maybe this is for the better so i can study instead of play , because i would definitely be playing that and metal gear solid but only on weekends hahaha i'm a girl that plays video games i'm weeeeeiiiiiirrrrd i wonder if i can get that job at the lancave i would be ever so haaaaapppyyy that would be awesome it does not seem hard at all just like the same stuff i did at eb but instead of renting people games i sold it to them i do not miss eb at all i wonder if julia left yet that place is the devil and video games are the spawn of the devil i wonder what marky is doing over at uofh i hope he 's having fun and he 's not regretting his decision to go to uofh instead of ut yah we used to be big ut heads then he changed his mind and i changed my mind and then i changed my mind again and the i changed my mind back again to ut and now here i am woot woot go me i think i'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome i hope there 's free therapy after this writing exercise blaaaaaaah i have not met very many people that are into stuff that i'm into except for maryam i ca not wait to meet some other dorky kids that are into videogames and japanese and cute fashion stuff i want to go to anime club on friday but i will be going all alone because i m sure that ashley will not come with me but maryam might ! i totally forgot i will call and ask her but that means that i have to give up wushu practice maaan i have such big dreams but i have no idea which ones to follow that gets frustrating okay if i decide to give up wushu then maybe i can get into fencing or maybe even kendo but wushu is so neeeeaaat ! but i do not know if i even have the strength to do it it 's crazy maybe i should not do and just try again next year no hard feelings , i hope i do not even know if i will have money to pay for that i hope i get any job on campus i'm just bleh i hope i get to stop being so anti social i'm not really anti social just a bit shy and cautious about who i talk to i think that 's a good thing however , it can be very lonely my wrists hurt i wonder if my brother is having fun at home probably not lol he never seems to be having fun when he 's alone aww now i feel bad for leaving him maybe he will be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something i do not want him to be all lonely like i was as a junior in high school i wonder if my older brother has decided to go to graduate school yet or if he 's really thinking about that invention thing heh at least he 's got his major and he 's doing it in 4 years go him he 's my hero hahaha i'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do , because i sure do not i'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need , and doing something that i looooove to do with all my heart i have found , thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship , that i can learn to love almost anything which is a bad thing i have no idea what i'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out i already feel like i'm running out of time right now as i sit here typing out a required assignment it 's crazy and frustrating and i do not ' want to try to do too many things at once , because that is what caused my uber dramatic downfall my senior year okay maybe it was not a downfall but it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think i would know already , having been a human for almost 19 years silly me oh well it wo not happen again here , because i'm not in baytown and i'm away from people that drag me down i can choose who to interact with most times here , so that puts me in a position of power i rarely have yaaay for college very glad i'm here and not in baytown
2004_484.txt 1 1 1 0 0 i have so much work to do and it all seems to just pile up on me in highschool i think was so used to just doing things the nigh before and i knew i could get it on but now that i'm in college i ca not be doing that stuff i had a weird dream when i took a nap after my 3 30 class i drempt that i was at my physic teachers wedding and i was in the third row i believe and the lady he was marrying who was a chemistry teacher was mad that me and my friend were there at the wedding the rings they were getting married with were being passed around and they both had big pearls on them right before the ceremony began my physics teacher looked back and recognized he had two former students at his wedding me and my friend and he smiled and then the dream ended i kind of freaked out , i'm not sure why when i woke up i wanted to call my friend and tell her about the dream i did not end up calling her after i had been awake for a while i started thinking about my junior year in highschool which is when i had my physics teacher , he was a pretty good teacher , i really learned a lot that year my parents are coming up this weekend for the ut game , i get to see my little brother so i'm real excited for that i miss him a lot i just ate wendy 's a little while ago and i'm stuffed i'm exhausted , my mind and body are very tired last night i fell asleep around 1 00 and that 's the earliest i have fallen asleep since i have been here in austin in between and after classes i find myself napping and i think that makes it worse because at night i ca not sleep at all me and my roommate really get along , i like that okay i think i'm going brain dead , or maybe its because i'm tired i'm happy i'm getting this out of the way now rather than the day before , i know its not a big deal but still it helps to just finish these things a little earlier than expected i love austin so much i miss my friends back at home but i do not miss the valley , which is where i'm from , edinburg to be exact it 's ' funny how things just fly by so fast , i wonder if college will fly by as fast as highschool did who knows ! i feel overwhelemd , not just with reading and school work but with other things beside that my parents expect me to bring all a 's and i guess that can be possible but come on , i do not think i will get all a 's through college i just want to do well enough to get into the graduate school i want to go too another thing that 's bothering me is the whole boy problem thing my boyfriend goes to utsa and its not the long distance thing that is bothering me , it 's the whole being tied down part there 's so many people to meet here and i care about my boyfriend a lot but he messed up once and my ways of thinking about him and i have altered in a sense that could there really be someone else out there for me my mom says i will never know unless i venture out and see what could be out there i think i'm the type of person that is nice , maybe too nice why do people take advantage of that it 's not fair i think i need to be a more stronger person when it comes to certain issues i guess these are just the typical girl problems it 's funny how guys do not really care or think about things like that it 's also funny how guys minds are so much different from girls and how their views are completely oppposite i really need to catch up with reading in psychology , i think that 's the only think i'm a little behind in , as far as reading i want to have a good semester and leave during the christmas holidays knowing that i did my best as far as that semester was concerned today in astronomy we talked about the stars and how old they are and all that stuff and today when i was walking back from wendy 's , i could not help but look up at the moon and stars and then reflect back to my astronomy class all that stuff is so cool i would love to go to the moon that would be cool , but its one of those things i want to do but probably would not do it if i could well time is almost up and i enjoyed this a lot bye !

2004_490.txt 0 0 1 0 1 i was not expecting to get sick , but for some strange reason , i am sneezing , coughing , and everything , it is crazy i am surprising myself lately though i thought i would be much more home sick , but i do not know what i am missing , or if i am missing anything at all i know i miss work , nothing made me more happy really i know it was not fun all the time , but the people there made it worthwhile one in particular , no two in particular both for different reasons i wonder when life is going to get easy i have been working hard since i was 16 , balancing a job , school , and trying to have a life trying is the key word sometimes i think i missed out in high school i was never the party type , only because my parents would not let me do anything , but i understand that they just want the best for me and do not want me to make the same mistakes that they made what they do not understand is that , it is holding me back , because eventually i may be in the same situation that they were in , and i wo not know what to do if i were to live anywhere in the world i would live in england , surrey was nice london is amazing i do not know what to say other than when i was there i felt home , i loved it i surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather than drive i enjoy taking drives though when i was at home , i enjoyed just grabbing my keys and going i never had a particular destination , but my favorite drives were at night , with the sun roof open , oh how it was so peaceful kind of like sailing recently i joined the saililng club , it is nice , i wish there was more wind my first sail , but even so it was still unbelievably calm , and placid it was so nice , and made time go by so fast i feel so stupid about endochine , i ca not believe we were just talking to them and did not know it was then , awwww i feel so stupid but then again there are a lot of times i feel stupid too many to list i can not wait to go to the football game i miss band the most from high school , there was nothing like marching into the stadium , especially this past year when the crowd was actually happy that we were there i honestly never thought i would see the day that that would happen christina aguilera 's cd is very good , at least most of it it is kind of sad at the same time it is surprising how cold it was this morning , here i am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like 70 unbelievable this is supposed to be texas i am so glad my aunt and her partner are here , even if lester is not exactly the most honest or faithful person , it is still nice to see linda i love accents , i wish i had an english accent for some reason i especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with mate or love another reason i want to move to london , i love the way they talk i also love orlando bloom who also lives in england , he is gorgeous but sometimes i wonder if he , in real life is stuck up or real down to earth that irritates me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want , and the way people gravel at their feet they are no different from the average joe other than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it pretty sweet deal actually , i wish someone would pay me to be someone else so i could live a fairy tale sometimes i wish life were like a movie , not like the faculty though more like kate and leopold mostly love stories , that would be amazing though at the same time it might be too predictable one can wish though right i wonder what i am going to be when i grow up , i mean really grow up i really have no likes or dislikes , which sometimes makes me wonder , if i have a personalitly , or if i am just here how is it possible for people to exist anyways i do not know if i buy the whole evolution thing or the bible if the bible is true then were did the dinosaurs come from and if vice versa then how did the bible come about i still believe there is a god because i think it is important to have something to believe in but sometimes i think what if god was not real there would be many times i would be lost in my life in that case for some reason i think there is some sort of force that looks out for people ,
2004_492.txt 1 0 0 1 1 well i am sitting here in my bed just before 11 am on a thursday morning writing out a conscious stream of my thoughts my girlfriend is coming to see me this weekend and i'm excited about that , as well as the fact that my best friend is going back home for the weekend and leaving his apartemnt at my disposal an apartment is a much better place to stay with your girlfriend than any god forsaken dormatory , especially since my room mate will be here football game saturday agains unt , and i love my football i have always loved college football and now that i get to go and watch my team , one of the best in the nation , play is a great experience for me , on that i will enjoy greatly for the next few years speaking of which , i'm pretty hacked off that i was unaware that you had to purchase tickets to the ou game seperately , and more than that , that there was no obvious information on the season ticket website about this i'm getting back into the flow of school again , and most of my classes seem like they will be rather easy , assuming that i read the material and pay attention in class , which i might add is tough to do on a regular basis i have havent attended a single calculus study session which greatly frees up my tuesdays and thursdays , having only one class in the late afternoon i love not having to write with proper punctuation and capitalization the experiment in class the other day was very interesting i personally though lie detectors were a bunch of crap , but the psychological side of them is pretty interesting i would not mind doing a psychological study of poker players and how they interact while playing hold 'them , etc some of the calls they make about other peoples hands are simply amazing what makes someone fold a good hand what makes a person be able to win on a bluff these are interesting events to me but anyways , i wish i did not have any homework this weekend , as a matter of fact i need to finish reading chapter three in my psyc book , i will attend to that after i finish writing this hmmmm , what else , oh yeah last night i played with four of my friends in a pick up game at the gym the first game we won , the second game we won , and the third game we lost by one shot to a team led by a steriod , testosterone over pumped crazy kid who was a complete jerk it 's interesting that everyone on my team was pissed off , except for me they are normally the ones who tell me to chill out cause i get mad and stuff i sort of miss dallas and my girl , but i know that we are both very committed and that she loves me a lot she 's a great girl and i would hate to have to do all this without her , although i wish she was at tsu , that would make things much , much easier i'm really hungry , i wish this timer would hurry up , i need to shave , wash my face , brush my teeth , eat something , finish reading , do some homework , and study for a quiz i have tomorrow in economics i hope that quiz wo not be too hard i will just have to memorize the stuff in the book such as the expendeture approach to gdp , which is that gdp c i g ( i'm ex ) wow , i'm really glad i can remember that and i havent even studied yet , but the income approach is a little harder , even though i know i can get that easily if i just study it for a little while will thanks for the time , my 20 are up bye
2004_493.txt 0 1 0 1 0 i'm home wanted to go to bed but remembered that i had a psychology homework to complete by sometime during next week maybe this would not take that long i can handle this something is making a noise in the restroom did i turn on the fan i got to write more this is harder than i thought i'm not thinking anything was i always like this when i did not have anything to do should i go to bed after finishing this assignment or should i stay awake i think i had an appointment with someone or maybe it was some kind of meeting , that was not mandatory to participate in is there any assignments besides this my roommate took my digital camera yesterday , but it 's right beside me , now wonder what he did with it i will ask him when he comes back my eyes hurt i should really do something about my glasses when should i go fix it feel tired i should really go to bed only 9 minutes passed half way done wonder if i can just stop here maybe not hm let 's see what am i thinking wow my feet are covered with dirt amazing i did not notice that until now how did i get this on my legs i want to wash it off but i will wait until this assignment is over 8 minutes to go what are my parents doing anyway hope they are doing fine when would they be able to receive the email i sent few minutes ago anyways , i feel like i really had to finish something today but ca not remember what it was guess i will figure it out after taking a nap am i still not there never knew how long a 20 minute could be thirsty no water around now i'm curious what the purpose of this assignment is and what kind of point professor is trying to make time is almost up

2004_497.txt 0 0 1 0 0 it is wednesday , december 8th and a lot has been going on this semester i am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive , i know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class with two test left , there was still a chance to make an a or b in the class which was expected it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well , the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an a or b to get simply trying to get a c and pass granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 10 different assignments and three test , it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to a 's and a b 's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an a on the other my only focus has been on the two exams on saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues it seems as though just when i try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up this semester the fact that i was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something i did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but i still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a 's which is very possible for me to achieve making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong all i can do is my best the rest is out of my hands i have to do something to make it easier for my parents
2004_498.txt 0 1 0 0 1 man this week has been hellish anyways , now it 's time for the 20 minute writing assignment i'm pretty exhausted at the moment , and have a lot of studying to do tonight my eyelids are pretty heavy , my hair damp i just got out of the shower because i was working out i think i have developed a pretty noticable case of add ( attention deficate disorder ) from various substances it 's difficult for me to keep writing without my mind wandering my friend just walked in the room talking about some funny asian kids next door to us now its going to be even harder to concentrate he just said the word tit it 's such a funny word , i'm sure you would agree my mouth tastes like butt , i need to stop smoking cigarettes crap , i just looked at the time and realized i did not record what time i started at i hope this thing is timing it for me simply type continuously , tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes my thoughts are scrambled so much to soak in , so much going on individual words strike up new emotions about various subjects my friend said the word mom , i thought of my mom i do not want to go home and probably would not except for the fact that my mom misses me so much i keep getting distracted by music that i'm playing , it 's probably not best to be listening to it while working , but this is an informal assignment ( if i remember correctly ) so hopefully i will be fine i ca not wait for tomorrow to be over and the weekend to begin the band i'm listening to is called the roots , they will be playing next weekend at acl i would really like to see them there , they are a really good and well known hip hop group tix are 80 bucks so its doubtful ill be going all 3 days , maybe i will just get a one day pass i could also meet a lot of people at the acl fest ( hopefully ) i feel kind of lonely at the moment , i thought i would have made a lot more knew friends here at the university by now it seems to me that most people are still hanging out with their friends and clicks from high school , kind of lame in my opinion i hang out with my roommate and another friend from high school , most of the time the latter we go out and attempt to seek out other people like us , whom we find unique or cool one major complaint i have about the people here is that it seems like everyone is still trying to prove themselves just like high school , except more facial hair i might just be depressed and seeing everything in a negative light , but at the moment it all seems logical to me my friend just came back in the room he 's cool we are going to go study chemistry as soon as i'm done with this assignment man i need to stop chatting on the internet , my typing is really horrible i keep forgetting to capitalize letters , and i keep spelling things incorectly like i was saying , it 's a pitty that everyone here seems so fake do not get me wrong , there are a lot of people that seem really interesting , but at the same mind it sickens me how everyone conforms to certain styles and clicks god damn , grow up people everyone 's trying so hard to get laid please do not grade me down i ca not help but writing about this crap , it consumes me writing this actually has not been hard at all right now i'm feeling a little more relaxed and lighthearted than i was before writing it might be a good idea to start writing regularly it could be good for me , and i think it 's cool when people do things like that i love writing , but not necessarily structured writing i wonder how long it 's been my whole body is tired , man i'm lonely i need a girlfriend ! party 's are not a good way to meet girls here , stupid sluts just looking for a good time it seems like there are less people here like me than i thought there would be i was expecting a more mature student body do not get me wrong , i like partying , i love getting drunk , i love having fun i do not know where i'm going with this it just seems people here are kind of stuck up on themselves , and not as intelligent and interesting as i thought they would be oh well , we all can dream
2004_499.txt 0 1 1 0 1 i have just gotten off the phone with brady i'm trying to decide what exacly we will do this weekend he wants to go to a hotel , but i know i have to babysit and i'm not sure exactly how i will tell my dad to pick us up from here my birthday is this weekend , and it does not really even feel like it i do not really mind , but i have a feeling brady probably wo not do much for it i almost feel like i'm always doing something for him i should , i really care about him he says he will pay for the hotel , but i do not really want that for my birthday i'ts just not htat important to me i feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the tip program i know that sometimes i have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand i have not heard from my mom so i'm not sure if she 's mad at me or not she probably does not care , but when she does find out she will freak i wish brady would pay more attention he tries so hard , but it does not seem like he has the chance to do so i need to work out i'm feeling that although i do not weigh that much my weight is getting out of control perhaps i'm overreacting kristen and i went shopping yesterday i really do not plan on shopping anymore yikes we do not really need anything anyways i need a strapless bra though i'm surprised i did not get one oh well i wish i could figure out what to do on friday with brady i want kristen to be able to hang out with us too he 's concerned that i tell her too mucha bout our personal life , but i really do not dana kind of pisses me off why is everyone so negative about a caring relationship she 's probably just jealous , she has not been able to keep a guy at all for a long time i'm concerned for her because i do not want her to be doing drugs anymore , but she probably is she has too much sex too lol it 's hard to not be concerned with what your friends are doing kristen is surprisingly very understanding to everything that 's going on in my life she 's caring and funny to be around i was not sure what to expect since she 's friends with kristin , hayley etc they apparently are not waht i expected them to be they play if off to be all god like , when in all realtiy they judge pretty much everyone i do not think that is right although i'm not that religious , i do care about god and do not think that those kinds of behavior are fair i'm looking att he picture of brady and me kris was kind of weird about the whole boyfriend thing i hope that brady and i last i would do anything to spend the rest of my life with him i care about him so much , and the distance hurts i think it isi probably for the best though i ca not imagine having to go to school with him his roommates are not as crazy as i thought , but bad enough i jut hope that he does not get heavy into drinking , a nd i do not assume he will sarah is a bitch , i ca not believe she comes off like taht ugh , it really bothers me i wonder what it 's like at home without me there my mom is making a big deal about me not calling , but in all honesty i just do not care i do not know why i'm so unfeeling lately it 's probably because i'm about to start my period maybe i will skip it this month , in fact i probably will i do not usually have allergies , but for some reason my eyes keep tearing it 's either my contacts or allergies i just changed my contacts though i really have to pee the eyes watering is a little embarrassing sometimes i wish i coiuld do more i kind of wish i woul dhave rushed to be in a sorority i feel as though i ahve no friends because i have lost them to brady should i go to florida with my parents during spring break or should i spend time with brady instead maybe i could make money babysitting that would be nice i hope my parents are not mad because i want to babysit on saturday instead ofdoing my birthday thing i do not see why it would be that big of a deal , but apparently it is i kind of want to go tanning , but it 's not good with my current skin situation and whatnot that reminds me of richard rush i wonder how he is doing spoiled brat i'm really hungry too i'm not sure what i'm going to eat , but i wish kristen would get here so taht we can go eat that would be really good lol i'm hoping that i wo not look old when i'm 25 or so heck , i do not even know what i want to do with my life i almost feel as though if i marry brady will accomplish everything i want so badly to be with him forever no one understand me like he does i wish i had saved myself for him , like he did for me how is he able to only commit to me i must care about him so much that he feels like he should i'm glad that i have gotten to know hhis family a lot better his mom is honestly really nice to me , and i do not ahve a problem with her anymore it would be awesome to be ilke paris hilton she 's has it really good i wonder what it would be like if my parents lived more like they should they are always trying to save money when in reality being multi millionaires does not mean that you should only do that perhaps it 's a shock from the inheritance or something i do not know it 's confusing to me ok , this is getting old i'm a little tired of writing it 's probably because i'm hungry i'm a little confused as to what i should study here at school i have had an interst in psychology , but do i really want to do that for the rest of my life i know it does not just end here , but i feel as though there are not many options when it comes to what i can do with my life yay , kristen got back and we can go eat now my time is almost over i'm about to pee in my pants too ahhhhh ! ! ! ! ! some people try to hard
